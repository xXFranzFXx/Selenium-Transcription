Hi there.

1
00:00:01.405 --> 00:00:04.575
Welcome to How to release the trauma trapped in your body

2
00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:07.055
for good without ears, more of therapy

3
00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:09.935
or jumping into new modalities and workshops every month.

4
00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:12.695
Now I know that is a big promise,

5
00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:15.055
but I can tell you that it's absolutely true.

6
00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.815
I see it every single day and working with my clients

7
00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:19.255
and I have been doing this work

8
00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.175
with people all over North America for 10 years plus

9
00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:23.775
and that, uh,

10
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.015
before that even in my clinical acupuncture and natural health practice.

11
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.295
So I know that it can work for you,

12
00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.215
but more on that in just a second.

13
00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:34.435
Now, I hate it when I log into trainings

14
00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.515
and they take forever with the small talk

15
00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.915
or the intro, so I'm actually gonna get right down to it.

16
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:41.595
So I want you to grab a pen for notes.

17
00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.075
You're gonna wanna take some of those,

18
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:45.395
put your cell phone on vibrate, let you know,

19
00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.075
let the fa know that you're having you time

20
00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:48.875
and uh, let's dive in.

21
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.355
And if you're making dinner

22
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.435
or folding laundry while you watch this, just be ready

23
00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:53.995
to hit pause so that you can take some notes.

24
00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:57.595
And of course, don't, you know, just try to listen to this

25
00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:59.035
with just watching the screen on silence.

26
00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:00.315
You'll miss too much of it

27
00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:01.795
and you won't really be able to get the benefit.

28
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.155
So just a reminder also that you have a limited time

29
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:07.595
to watch this training and I'll send you a few reminders,

30
00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.635
but let's face it, time can slip away, so just make sure

31
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.195
that you actually get the time to watch it.

32
00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.995
And I also want to briefly switch on my camera here so

33
00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.595
that you can see me for just a second.

34
00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:18.775
Let me do that.

35
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.205
Okay, good. I think you can see my face.

36
00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.045
So just wanted to switch over so that you could just

37
00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:30.325
see me here, kind of feel my heart vibe

38
00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.845
and just know that I am a real person, I'm real,

39
00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:35.285
my company is real.

40
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.565
You know, our training organization, we're all real people

41
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.125
and I'm here in my home office.

42
00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.605
It's a little echoey. We have kind of nice high ceilings,

43
00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:44.925
which is great for the light, but a little funny on the

44
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.805
audio and just wanted to be able to connect

45
00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:49.005
with you in this way.

46
00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:51.125
And so you can see that you know,

47
00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:52.485
I'm, I'm not an influencer.

48
00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.605
I don't really care how things look so much on the surface.

49
00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.245
I'm really most concerned with getting results

50
00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:01.725
and using my background clinically and personally and

51
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.685
otherwise to really help you get breakthroughs.

52
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.605
And I'm also a real person, so wanted you to see that.

53
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.565
I'm gonna flip back to the slide so

54
00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:10.485
that you won't be distracted by looking at my face the whole

55
00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:14.405
time and uh, we can dive into this important info together.

56
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:16.845
Okay, now very quickly,

57
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:19.205
let's make sure you are in the right place.

58
00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:22.925
This is going to be for you if you have been working on

59
00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:25.965
yourself doing healing work and you still feel stuck.

60
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.525
You have done your fair share of therapy

61
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.725
or shadow work so you intellectually already understand

62
00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:34.565
things like how your upbringing created certain

63
00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:35.725
patterns, et cetera.

64
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.125
But just because you know it in your mind,

65
00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:40.645
you are still getting sucked into those same old

66
00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:41.685
grooves in the moment.

67
00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.725
This is for you if you've been reading books, going

68
00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.245
to workshops, jumping from modality to modality

69
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.645
or definitely for you if you've grown

70
00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.205
and gotten benefit from those things.

71
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.085
But even when you feel sort of optimistic

72
00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:57.045
or inspired at first, you notice that

73
00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:58.925
after a short while you're doing,

74
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.120
doing the same old patterns

75
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.805
and those deeper issues are still there.

76
00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:04.605
This is for you if you've noticed that you tend

77
00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.325
to leave your body or you tend to be in your head.

78
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:10.705
You may be an empath or a sensitive person

79
00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:13.145
and tend to take on energy that's not yours.

80
00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:16.225
Or you seem to attract kind of narcissistic chi vampires,

81
00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:19.145
um, and people that you feel like you need to fix or rescue.

82
00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:22.625
This is for you if you might actually be feeling some

83
00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.345
imposter syndrome because you have this feeling like

84
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.905
with all the work I've done, I should be farther than this

85
00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:31.345
or I shouldn't feel this way.

86
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:33.985
Or maybe you're a healer helping other people

87
00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:36.225
or secretly feeling like a fraud

88
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:38.345
because you're trying to help people

89
00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:40.545
with their issues while you haven't really been able

90
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:41.625
to heal them in yourself.

91
00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:44.305
I know what that's like. You're in the right place if you

92
00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:46.145
become aware that you're carrying a lot

93
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.825
of generational trauma that isn't even yours,

94
00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:51.865
but you don't know what to do to actually get free from that

95
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.185
or to do it differently.

96
00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:56.025
And you're definitely in the right place if you've noticed

97
00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.665
what we call resistance.

98
00:03:57.845 --> 00:03:59.865
Now this can show up as a tendency

99
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.985
to self-sabotage when things are going well

100
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.385
or you implement like crazy at first,

101
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.025
but then you totally fall off the wagon

102
00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.545
and you seem to forget the things that you've learned

103
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:12.465
or what we call sneaky resistance, a sneaky form

104
00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:15.905
of resistance where you always feel like you just need

105
00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.145
to know more before you're ready.

106
00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.025
This is actually a protector system strategy that we'll kind

107
00:04:21.025 --> 00:04:22.625
of touch on a little bit later in the training.

108
00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.025
And one of the key things

109
00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:25.665
that we address in subtle body work

110
00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.985
that other modalities miss.

111
00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:30.835
So if you've been experiencing any of these things,

112
00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.835
believe me, I know I have been in all of those places

113
00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.435
and if any of this sounds like you, I want you

114
00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:39.035
to know this struggle is not your fault.

115
00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:40.115
There is a lot

116
00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:44.155
of crappy information out there from mainstream ungrounded

117
00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:48.715
self-help advice to therapy based on old outdated science.

118
00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:52.675
Many people make it look like they have all the answers

119
00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:55.235
and they make it seem like all you have

120
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.355
to do is do some simple magic wand affirmations

121
00:04:58.415 --> 00:04:59.635
or wear some crystals

122
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.275
and your life will completely transform life coaches

123
00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:07.155
and new agey abundance self-love goddesses on social media

124
00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:10.195
make it seem like all you need is you know,

125
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:12.355
an ayahuasca retreat in a gorgeous location

126
00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:14.795
and you'll have a sustainable life breakthrough.

127
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:17.275
But that's actually pretty far from the truth.

128
00:05:18.135 --> 00:05:20.355
Now, if you're a practitioner of any of those modalities

129
00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:22.835
and you feel offended like I've just bashed things

130
00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:24.675
that you love, I want you to know that

131
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:25.755
that's not my intention.

132
00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:28.795
So I hope you'll be able to open up

133
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.715
to hear the essence of what I'm saying.

134
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:34.075
There are lots of helpful modalities out there

135
00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:35.315
and I have a big piece

136
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:36.995
of rose quartz sitting on my desk right now.

137
00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:40.795
And if you're here, what you're looking

138
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:45.675
for is a clear proven path to lasting systemic change

139
00:05:46.365 --> 00:05:50.275
where you truly live as your true self soul aligned,

140
00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:54.515
where you don't get thrown off by other people's stress

141
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.485
and where you feel deeply peaceful, solidly, okay,

142
00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.965
within yourself and your relationships no matter

143
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:02.085
what life brings.

144
00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:03.965
Does that sound like something you'd wanna hear about?

145
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.885
So I know what's going on

146
00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:08.725
behind the scenes in the world of healing.

147
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.925
I have tried, studied,

148
00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:13.525
or been certified in most healing methods that you can think

149
00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:16.405
of and I've been a board certified licensed

150
00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:17.845
acupuncturist for a decade.

151
00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:20.885
What you see on the surface when people talk about healing

152
00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.445
is not always what it appears to be.

153
00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:26.725
It's easy to present a certain image on social media

154
00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:29.285
with fancy pictures and a polished brand,

155
00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.165
but that doesn't necessarily mean

156
00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:34.085
that the practitioner is delivering the depth of healing

157
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:35.725
that people truly need.

158
00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:39.425
So back to correcting the bad information,

159
00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:41.385
you've probably heard that

160
00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:43.945
to heal you just need to do the work.

161
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.185
You just need to express your emotions.

162
00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:49.305
You just need to understand how your environment growing up

163
00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:51.465
and your parents shaped, shaped your reactions.

164
00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:54.305
You just need to get in touch with your shadow side.

165
00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:58.105
Well, that's what therapy does, so

166
00:06:58.535 --> 00:06:59.905
that must be right, right?

167
00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:02.545
Except that those of us who have done lots

168
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.585
of therapy can tell you,

169
00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:06.465
and I'm including myself in this group, we know

170
00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:07.505
that therapy can be

171
00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.945
so helpful in helping us understand the situation better,

172
00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:14.505
but it doesn't actually change our automatic behaviors.

173
00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:17.505
It doesn't stop us from getting triggered in the moment

174
00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:21.225
and it doesn't automatically help us really know why we're

175
00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:23.225
here and what we should be doing in our life.

176
00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:25.465
Think about it, knowing

177
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.665
that someone like your mom is wounded

178
00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.985
and in insecure from what she went

179
00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.545
through growing up doesn't actually change the fact

180
00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:34.305
that you feel hurt and take it personally.

181
00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.705
When she criticizes how you prepare a holiday meal

182
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:37.905
or how you're raising your kids,

183
00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:40.185
you still end up feeling triggered and hurt

184
00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:43.545
and unable to let it go for days when what you want is

185
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:44.825
to enjoy a holiday together.

186
00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:47.625
Now, okay, I'm gonna dig into all

187
00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:49.185
of this more in just a little bit.

188
00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:51.865
And of course also how to remove the source

189
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:54.225
of the issue in you so that you can feel calm

190
00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:57.185
and connected without changing how your family

191
00:07:57.285 --> 00:07:59.425
or your coworkers or your spouse act,

192
00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:02.985
whatever your situation is, the secret to actually changing

193
00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:04.265
how you feel in the moment

194
00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:06.145
and releasing the source of the trauma

195
00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:09.465
from your body in a way that doesn't come back.

196
00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:10.585
That's what we're talking about.

197
00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:14.945
So instead of doubting yourself, hiding who you are to try

198
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.345
and please other people, not

199
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.585
to mention staying stuck in relationships

200
00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:19.785
that no longer serve you

201
00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:21.145
and letting people walk all over you

202
00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:24.505
because you're trying to be nice, we're going to get you

203
00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:26.705
to a very different place in your life

204
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.985
and you are going to be able to stop constantly worrying,

205
00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:31.465
stop feeling insecure

206
00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:34.905
or searching for the next thing you think you need to learn

207
00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:36.945
how to finally somehow fix yourself.

208
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.305
Trying to guess at which thing will be the

209
00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:41.345
next magic solution.

210
00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:44.185
Is it reiki? Is it sound bass? Is it yoga teacher training?

211
00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.585
Is it somatic therapy? Is it breath work? On and on.

212
00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:49.265
So here's where we're going to get you.

213
00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:52.905
You are going to get to experience the calm,

214
00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:55.525
peaceful centeredness, happiness,

215
00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:59.685
and let's be honest, the relief of actually feeling aligned

216
00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:02.685
with your purpose, feeling infinitely grounded

217
00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:05.565
and completely okay even in situations

218
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:08.845
or with people that used to stress you out, you get

219
00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:13.005
to enjoy more fulfilling relationships feeling free from the

220
00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:15.085
trauma and blocks that were holding you back.

221
00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:17.925
Plus you're not going to have to meditate

222
00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:20.005
and sit for hours on a cushion for this to work.

223
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:23.245
You don't have to do major lifestyle overhauls like quitting

224
00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:25.205
all sugar or do some crazy workout routine

225
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:28.245
and you don't have to tell the same stories over

226
00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:31.525
and over again to new practitioner each month without really

227
00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:32.645
seeing results or changes.

228
00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:36.155
You get all of it. Okay, so

229
00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:38.585
very quickly, who am I?

230
00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:40.265
How do I know what I'm talking about?

231
00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:42.385
How dare I say these things about healing

232
00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:43.585
and therapy and trauma?

233
00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:46.065
So, hi, my name is Leslie Hutter

234
00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:48.265
and I'm a highly sensitive person and healer.

235
00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:52.185
I have dedicated my life to healing and spiritual practices

236
00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.225
and I've been a licensed acupuncturist,

237
00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:56.345
natural health clinician for over a decade.

238
00:09:56.925 --> 00:10:00.065
So like you, I spent a lot of my young adult life,

239
00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:02.025
quote unquote working on myself.

240
00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:04.545
I took my first yoga class as a teenager

241
00:10:04.565 --> 00:10:06.905
and I became a practical natural health expert

242
00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:09.385
as a college student to solve my own health issues.

243
00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:13.625
I was living in a yoga ashram in India on my 26th birthday

244
00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:15.705
and I had already been studying shiatsu

245
00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.145
and reiki while living in Japan.

246
00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:20.985
But even as I graduated from the top rated acupuncture

247
00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:22.185
college in the in the country

248
00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:23.905
and started my healing practice,

249
00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:27.825
I knew there were really still some places in my own healing

250
00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:29.265
where I was really blocked.

251
00:10:29.865 --> 00:10:32.105
I was really struggling in relationships with men.

252
00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:34.665
My healing business was a constant source

253
00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:37.985
of financial stress and I secretly felt like an imposter

254
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:39.665
because I hadn't healed my own crap,

255
00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:41.985
but I was putting myself out there to help others.

256
00:10:42.845 --> 00:10:46.385
And to be honest, even living in the natural health world,

257
00:10:46.705 --> 00:10:50.225
I didn't love the common approaches that people prescribed.

258
00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:54.265
I didn't wanna feel like I was in a codependent relationship

259
00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:55.305
with various healers.

260
00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:58.865
I didn't wanna have a lifelong therapist that I went to

261
00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:01.065
to rehash all of my problems with every week.

262
00:11:01.825 --> 00:11:04.145
I didn't wanna keep spending money on different new

263
00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:06.425
modalities every month that felt good

264
00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:08.145
but didn't really change my issues

265
00:11:08.165 --> 00:11:10.145
and left me back at the place where I started.

266
00:11:10.685 --> 00:11:12.785
And don't get me wrong, I did try all

267
00:11:12.785 --> 00:11:13.865
of those things for a while.

268
00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:17.305
I worked with several different somatic therapists over a

269
00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:19.505
couple of years and I got some good benefits,

270
00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:22.185
but I didn't like the feeling that they were grooming me

271
00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:24.185
to be there dependent clients for life.

272
00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:28.265
And I started to realize I had sort of hit a glass floor

273
00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:30.865
where I was stuck at this plateau

274
00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:32.745
of working on the same issues over

275
00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:34.785
and over again without really progressing.

276
00:11:35.685 --> 00:11:38.785
And because I was an adorable little baby empath healer,

277
00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:40.625
I thought that because I had

278
00:11:40.685 --> 00:11:43.625
so much healing knowledge in my brain that it would be easy

279
00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:44.865
for me, I'd just go

280
00:11:44.865 --> 00:11:47.105
to a few body-based somatic therapy sessions

281
00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:48.385
and I'd be back on my feet.

282
00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:52.745
So adorable, so naive, obviously that did not happen,

283
00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.685
or at least it didn't happen enough.

284
00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:58.645
I did feel a little emotionally, uh, less chaotic

285
00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:00.525
with the help of somatic therapy

286
00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:03.445
and I was getting people great healing results in my own

287
00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:06.725
clinic while slowly, slowly building my healing practice.

288
00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.605
But I still knew that I was stuck at some

289
00:12:09.835 --> 00:12:11.005
hard to reach levels.

290
00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:14.765
So from about 2010 to 2016, yes, six years,

291
00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:18.165
I kept trying all of the things, coaching, working

292
00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:20.965
with an energy healing healer, matrix, energetics,

293
00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:23.765
muscle testing, different types of energy work, more reiki,

294
00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:25.125
more acupuncture, shadow work

295
00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:27.285
and archetypes, meditation, past life regression.

296
00:12:28.065 --> 00:12:32.165
And throughout all of this flailing I was frustrated trying

297
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:35.605
to recover from a major relationship breakup, barely getting

298
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:39.125
by financially and feeling more and more like an imposter.

299
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.725
I couldn't really even tell my friends

300
00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:43.085
or family what was going on

301
00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:44.605
with me like I'm telling you right now.

302
00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:48.435
I knew there had to be a better way.

303
00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:51.875
I wanted to know how it all fit together,

304
00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.915
but in a practical way, not just theoretically in my mind,

305
00:12:56.755 --> 00:13:00.395
I wanted to get to the real source of an issue

306
00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:03.035
and know exactly how to get it out of my body

307
00:13:03.035 --> 00:13:05.635
and meridian system so that it did not come back.

308
00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:09.075
I wanted to be able to identify

309
00:13:09.785 --> 00:13:11.355
what my heart actually wanted

310
00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:13.675
and then be able to practically manifest

311
00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:16.355
that without a bunch of woowoo new agey b******t mixed in.

312
00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:18.355
I wanted to live

313
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:21.435
as a spiritual person without the spiritual bypassing

314
00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.155
that I saw in the healer community.

315
00:13:24.075 --> 00:13:27.555
I wanted to heal my dysfunctional patterns with men

316
00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:29.355
and I didn't really know where to start.

317
00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:33.155
I wanted to get my clients the fastest results possible

318
00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:35.715
and I could see there was this deeper level

319
00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:39.785
that I wasn't able to get to yet I understood

320
00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.145
that things weren't a quick fix,

321
00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:43.865
but I didn't wanna have to do a particular practice

322
00:13:43.885 --> 00:13:46.065
for years with just blind faith

323
00:13:46.065 --> 00:13:48.065
before I could actually know if it

324
00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:49.145
was working for me or not.

325
00:13:50.555 --> 00:13:53.035
I wanted to actually track and measure results

326
00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:56.755
and not just have some like amorphous, undefined, vague,

327
00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:59.515
hopeful feeling if I was improving or not.

328
00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:00.955
And yes, we are one

329
00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:03.435
of the only programs in the trauma healing

330
00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:05.235
and wellness space that actually

331
00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:06.555
measures and tracks results.

332
00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:08.595
I'll show you some of those numbers coming up here.

333
00:14:09.535 --> 00:14:12.315
So during all of this search, I had a sense

334
00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:15.995
that I was like one step away from connecting the dots

335
00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:19.355
between natural medicine, somatic therapy and mindfulness

336
00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:20.395
and spiritual practice.

337
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.555
Then I had a breakthrough

338
00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:26.715
and I realized that part of the problem was

339
00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:29.275
that everyone was missing a few keys to the puzzle.

340
00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:32.315
And what was really needed was a truly holistic,

341
00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:33.435
comprehensive system.

342
00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:35.315
It was grounded in ancient wisdom

343
00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:37.795
but adapted to our modern lives.

344
00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:42.955
I saw that natural health clinicians totally understood

345
00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:45.115
that emotions and trauma influence our health,

346
00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:47.395
but they weren't really trained to help people

347
00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:49.235
with their emotions in their inner world.

348
00:14:49.935 --> 00:14:51.405
And somatic therapists

349
00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:54.765
and counselors were trying to tie together the body

350
00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:57.605
and the mind, but they just did not have the deep background

351
00:14:57.945 --> 00:15:00.485
of the body and energy systems and ancient healing.

352
00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:02.965
So their methods were just slow

353
00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:04.405
and more of those

354
00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:06.645
that people needed if they're just like

355
00:15:06.755 --> 00:15:08.125
need beginner mindfulness.

356
00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:11.565
And I saw that spiritual teachers were a true gift,

357
00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:14.605
but often they don't focus on practical solutions

358
00:15:14.605 --> 00:15:16.605
for dealing with people's trauma

359
00:15:16.705 --> 00:15:18.325
and everyday interpersonal lives.

360
00:15:18.905 --> 00:15:20.565
And those things could become blocks

361
00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:21.885
to actual deeper progress.

362
00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:23.885
So I knew that spiritual practice

363
00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:25.725
and meditation had tremendous power

364
00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:28.045
to affect the deepest parts of us,

365
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:30.405
but I wanted to share the essence with people

366
00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:32.165
so they didn't have to make any changes

367
00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:33.485
to their own religious

368
00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:37.205
or spiritual worldviews to get the benefit I needed methods

369
00:15:37.275 --> 00:15:41.245
that were direct started clearing lifelong stuck patterns in

370
00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:43.445
weeks, not years, and didn't require someone

371
00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:45.565
to do meditation or take bad tasting herbs.

372
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.685
I realized that it was my unique background

373
00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:50.645
and experience in these three realms

374
00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:53.565
that when combined really created a truly comprehensive

375
00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.965
system that started getting clients rocket fuel

376
00:15:55.965 --> 00:15:58.885
breakthroughs where tons of other methods had failed.

377
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.165
So I started to take a totally different approach.

378
00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:06.565
The more I started to develop my own truly integrated mind,

379
00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:08.405
body, spirit or subtle body system

380
00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:12.005
and started focusing on these simultaneous interconnections

381
00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.765
of the subtle body, all of these layers,

382
00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:16.965
the faster results I started to see with myself

383
00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:19.605
and my clients just in my own life.

384
00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:23.165
I saw big changes in my experience with men.

385
00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:26.205
I started actually getting asked out for my phone number,

386
00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:28.325
which had never happened to me in my life.

387
00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:31.365
And I saw more emotionally healthy, divine,

388
00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:34.165
masculine aligned men showing in my up in my life,

389
00:16:34.165 --> 00:16:36.565
like in different roles from lovers to friends

390
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:38.565
to Airbnb guests who took me out to brunch.

391
00:16:39.225 --> 00:16:40.325
Within a year

392
00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:42.805
and a half of starting to really clear these blocks,

393
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:45.565
I met my better than I thought possible match Jay

394
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:50.525
who is now my husband and on a daily basis his presence just

395
00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:53.725
really helps me increase my capacity for joy in this life

396
00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:57.685
and he's really an amazing cook, which is a huge bonus.

397
00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:02.645
So also during that time my healing practice really took off

398
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:05.685
and I was able to actually support myself financially doing

399
00:17:05.685 --> 00:17:07.805
work that I love with more ideal clients

400
00:17:07.905 --> 00:17:09.645
who were really showing up ready

401
00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:11.805
to do real inner healing work.

402
00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:13.725
I even moved to a new state

403
00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:16.325
and built a new practice in half the time that I'd done

404
00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:18.205
before while working less hours,

405
00:17:19.885 --> 00:17:23.285
I suddenly had more confidence to start opening up

406
00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:25.805
and being vulnerable in a way that has led me

407
00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:27.925
to having deep dharma sister relationships

408
00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:30.965
and a group of soul sisters who really have my back in life.

409
00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:33.965
I stopped feeling apologetic

410
00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:38.245
or shy about who I was as a sensitive empath healer, uh,

411
00:17:38.245 --> 00:17:40.965
that let me sort of call in people who are more aligned

412
00:17:40.965 --> 00:17:42.005
with me being me.

413
00:17:42.425 --> 00:17:45.125
And it was so much easier to just let go of people

414
00:17:45.425 --> 00:17:47.645
who weren't without worrying what other people thought.

415
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:51.065
I even saw new levels of healing in my family

416
00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:53.865
and I started to be more confident just kind

417
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:57.025
of being my wacky self instead of censoring myself

418
00:17:57.085 --> 00:17:58.985
or trying to change how I was around them.

419
00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:02.505
And their really accepting responses have really

420
00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:03.905
strengthened our relationships in a

421
00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:04.985
way that I didn't even expect.

422
00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:09.745
I was actually able to step into my true spiritual alignment

423
00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:12.865
and soul clarity on my purpose why I am here

424
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.065
and what life is about.

425
00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:18.085
So my question to you is what would

426
00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:21.005
more fulfilling partnerships look like in your life?

427
00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:24.525
What difference would it make to you to feel truly confident

428
00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:26.685
and soul aligned in who you are?

429
00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:29.845
How would your life be different if you felt at peace in

430
00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:31.725
life, even when other people are freaking out,

431
00:18:31.835 --> 00:18:33.245
even when the world is freaking out

432
00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.045
and seems like it's going to hell in a hand basket?

433
00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:40.405
What kind of person, what kind of parent could you be

434
00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:42.925
to your children if your old trapped trauma were released

435
00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:44.725
and you weren't stuck in generational

436
00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:46.285
patterns that aren't even yours?

437
00:18:47.155 --> 00:18:48.575
Now, of course, I don't want you

438
00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:49.815
to just take my word for it.

439
00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:52.495
The key here is that this just didn't work for me.

440
00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:54.975
It's now a proven system that we've used

441
00:18:54.975 --> 00:18:57.455
to get consistent results for clients year

442
00:18:57.505 --> 00:18:58.975
after year after year.

443
00:18:59.855 --> 00:19:01.495
Remember those tracked results that I mentioned before?

444
00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:05.015
One of the biggest traps out there in the healing, wellness

445
00:19:05.115 --> 00:19:07.255
and therapy space is this lie

446
00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:09.455
that says something like you're always gonna be

447
00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:10.495
working on yourself.

448
00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:14.335
Things are intangible, it's the journey not the destination.

449
00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:17.775
How nonsensical is it to say

450
00:19:17.965 --> 00:19:19.855
that we shouldn't actually look for results?

451
00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:23.415
If you go into any, you know, any other business

452
00:19:23.435 --> 00:19:27.415
or realm, farming, business, manufacturing, gardening,

453
00:19:27.425 --> 00:19:29.495
there are always results to be,

454
00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:31.375
to be had and to be measured.

455
00:19:31.395 --> 00:19:32.895
So that's really what we're doing here.

456
00:19:33.635 --> 00:19:36.175
And while certainly there's more nuance

457
00:19:36.195 --> 00:19:37.215
to healing than other areas,

458
00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:39.135
we should always judge by results.

459
00:19:39.835 --> 00:19:42.975
We track data points in our programs so

460
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:45.295
that we make sure you are moving forward in

461
00:19:45.295 --> 00:19:46.735
clearly measurable ways.

462
00:19:47.835 --> 00:19:50.135
And you don't need to actually just take my word for it,

463
00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:51.735
you can actually see the results.

464
00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.135
These are before and

465
00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:58.415
after stats of all of the over 36 data points that we track

466
00:19:58.445 --> 00:20:00.295
with everybody who comes through the program.

467
00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.695
The light colored are before and the pink is

468
00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:04.935
after the 12 week program.

469
00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:09.815
So we track these categories over a wide range

470
00:20:09.835 --> 00:20:12.135
of everything in life from body intuition

471
00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:13.375
and connection, your physical

472
00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:15.335
and emotional wellbeing, people's finances,

473
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.535
lifestyle enjoyment, how much people are taking vacations,

474
00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:22.575
communication, relationship, feeling of inner peace

475
00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:25.055
and aligned with their purpose, their stress,

476
00:20:25.275 --> 00:20:27.375
and for example, how long it takes them

477
00:20:27.395 --> 00:20:28.735
to recover from a trigger.

478
00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:31.015
Those actually we see go down instead of up.

479
00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:34.935
Instead of people being stuck for days and days and days

480
00:20:34.995 --> 00:20:37.255
and weeks and months, it goes down to, you know,

481
00:20:37.255 --> 00:20:38.615
maybe a couple hours, couple days.

482
00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:43.495
So even folks who are already therapists and counselors

483
00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:45.655
and already had quite high ratings also get better.

484
00:20:45.715 --> 00:20:49.045
And we see a lot of massively positive results

485
00:20:49.345 --> 00:20:51.965
and PO progress across different people in

486
00:20:51.965 --> 00:20:53.045
different aspects of the program.

487
00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:56.365
So people don't just feel better, they actually are better.

488
00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:59.565
Pretty cool, right? You'll hear more from some

489
00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:01.565
of the other Body Wisdom Academy grads in just a little bit.

490
00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:03.765
Okay, enough intro, let's dig into this.

491
00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:05.685
We've got a lot to cover

492
00:21:05.705 --> 00:21:07.645
and we're gonna go fast to get it all in,

493
00:21:07.665 --> 00:21:09.285
so I don't want to waste any time.

494
00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:10.845
Here is what you're gonna learn.

495
00:21:11.265 --> 00:21:12.285
Secret number one,

496
00:21:12.475 --> 00:21:15.805
your body mind spirit system has a technical interconnected

497
00:21:15.825 --> 00:21:18.325
wiring that is beyond the conscious mind alone.

498
00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:20.645
There are several layers, it is predictable

499
00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:23.045
and fixable when you know the deeper signs.

500
00:21:23.345 --> 00:21:26.645
And side note, most modalities are only addressing one

501
00:21:26.645 --> 00:21:29.445
or two pieces and don't understand the interconnected signs.

502
00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:32.085
Secret number two, learning the code

503
00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:34.325
to deactivate your triggers in the moment

504
00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:35.925
so you can dissolve them instead

505
00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:37.525
of constantly managing them.

506
00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:41.085
And secret number three, how to overcome imposter syndrome

507
00:21:41.105 --> 00:21:45.365
and self-sabotage once and for all and actually feel worthy

508
00:21:45.465 --> 00:21:46.845
and aligned with your purpose.

509
00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:50.855
Okay, so secret number one,

510
00:21:50.965 --> 00:21:54.495
your body mind spirit system has a technical interconnected

511
00:21:54.555 --> 00:21:57.655
wiring that is beyond the conscious mind level alone.

512
00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:01.335
Look, I get it, big name trauma therapist.

513
00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:03.455
Well-known psychiatrists and authors

514
00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:07.455
and even self-help influencers say you just need

515
00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:10.135
to understand your brain and nervous system

516
00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:11.255
and that will fix the problem.

517
00:22:11.675 --> 00:22:14.255
Now I think neurology and polyvagal theory

518
00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:16.055
and brain science in general is very cool.

519
00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:17.255
And I personally continue

520
00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:19.095
to take trainings from folks in these areas.

521
00:22:19.835 --> 00:22:23.375
And as you have probably noticed, knowing what parts

522
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.895
of your brain are being dominant when you're freaking out

523
00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:28.775
and having repetitive anxious thoughts doesn't actually do

524
00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:31.055
much to stop the repetitive anxious thoughts

525
00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:33.975
or your heart beating out of your chest just by saying

526
00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:36.415
to yourself, this is just my overactive amygdala,

527
00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:37.895
this is just my amygdala.

528
00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:39.975
Freaking out doesn't do a damn thing

529
00:22:39.995 --> 00:22:41.695
to actually change the sensation

530
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:43.415
that you're having in your body in the moment.

531
00:22:43.835 --> 00:22:46.215
And even if it does calm you down in the moment,

532
00:22:46.475 --> 00:22:48.655
the same trigger will just get you again in the future.

533
00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:51.495
So although it might seem sexy to learn

534
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.975
that your ventral medial prefrontal cortex has been affected

535
00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:56.815
by your trauma or the cortisol shuts down your hippocampus,

536
00:22:57.045 --> 00:23:00.055
that sounds cool, but it doesn't actually fix your problem.

537
00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:01.935
Think about it. Trying

538
00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:05.135
to treat trauma in this intellectual researchy way is like

539
00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:07.375
saying that reading a book about

540
00:23:07.475 --> 00:23:10.375
how car engines work will magically transform you into

541
00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:12.975
winning Formula one race car driver, I don't know about you,

542
00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:15.455
but that's not a car I wanna be a passenger in.

543
00:23:16.275 --> 00:23:18.055
Yes, you'll feel more knowledgeable,

544
00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:21.335
but you're generally not getting any different

545
00:23:21.335 --> 00:23:22.775
results compared to when you started.

546
00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.655
I know a lot of clients who have learned the hard way

547
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.695
that putting all their eggs in the research

548
00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:30.055
and brain science basket may get them a fancy worded

549
00:23:30.215 --> 00:23:32.495
diagnosis or an expensive colorful looking scan

550
00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:34.895
of their brain, but it doesn't actually change their

551
00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:36.095
experience in the moment.

552
00:23:36.995 --> 00:23:39.655
And here's the thing, you can gain the ability

553
00:23:39.715 --> 00:23:42.335
to actually change the way you are feeling in the moment

554
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:45.365
and actually prevent a panic attack before it starts.

555
00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:47.445
You can make overwhelm

556
00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:49.165
and shut down episodes a thing

557
00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:50.845
of the past without suppressing them

558
00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:53.005
or memorizing hard to pronounce parts

559
00:23:53.005 --> 00:23:54.285
of your brain and nervous system.

560
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.245
Now it's the difference

561
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:59.085
between getting a stuck in a building,

562
00:23:59.215 --> 00:24:00.605
let's say getting stuck in a building

563
00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:02.645
where there's a fire alarm going off

564
00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:06.125
and the only thing you can do is in the room

565
00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:07.845
that you're trapped in, you can read

566
00:24:07.845 --> 00:24:10.005
through a 300 page manual about the history

567
00:24:10.005 --> 00:24:14.925
of fire alarm systems versus instead being trapped in a room

568
00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:16.925
in a building where the alarm goes off.

569
00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:18.885
But in that room with you is someone

570
00:24:18.885 --> 00:24:21.005
who teaches you the code to enter,

571
00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:23.285
which immediately turns off the alarm

572
00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:26.085
and resets the system so you can continue

573
00:24:26.145 --> 00:24:28.565
to go on your day in peace and quiet.

574
00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:32.165
Which one of those fire alarms rooms would you rather be in?

575
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:34.645
That's the one where someone teaches you the code, right?

576
00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:37.565
Not only does it turn off the code the first time,

577
00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:42.325
but now you have that code forever turning off the alarm

578
00:24:42.465 --> 00:24:44.365
and resetting the system isn't going

579
00:24:44.365 --> 00:24:48.525
to happen from talk therapy or even somatic therapy or EMDR.

580
00:24:48.525 --> 00:24:51.645
And here's why. And I wanna do a caveat here

581
00:24:51.645 --> 00:24:54.885
because I am not saying that therapy isn't useful.

582
00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:56.885
I wanna be really clear that I'm not anti therapy.

583
00:24:57.195 --> 00:25:00.205
I've done a good amount of therapy personally in my life

584
00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:01.525
and I think it's a useful tool.

585
00:25:01.865 --> 00:25:04.845
Having a great therapist can be a great healing relationship

586
00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:07.045
and the perspective, um, is very helpful,

587
00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:09.045
especially at the beginning of your healing journey.

588
00:25:09.865 --> 00:25:11.925
But that doesn't change the fact that

589
00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:14.845
what we call modern therapy developed from a culture

590
00:25:14.985 --> 00:25:19.005
of in their head, old white guys, European intellectuals

591
00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:20.485
who were testing different methods

592
00:25:20.905 --> 00:25:24.285
but were disconnected from deeper ancient wisdom about

593
00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:28.805
how the mind and the body and all of its parts fit together.

594
00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:31.445
This is what we call in my work Subtle body work.

595
00:25:31.665 --> 00:25:36.365
So now modern somatic therapy is an

596
00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:38.125
improvement upon traditional therapy

597
00:25:38.195 --> 00:25:40.165
because it takes the body into account,

598
00:25:40.395 --> 00:25:44.085
however it's still coming from that very hit

599
00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:45.285
or miss western approach.

600
00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:47.845
Even big name researchers like Besser VanDerKolk

601
00:25:47.845 --> 00:25:49.445
who wrote the Body keeps the score.

602
00:25:49.585 --> 00:25:50.685
He seems like a very nice person.

603
00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:53.405
I like watching his videos. But when you hear him talk about

604
00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:56.525
the early days of EMDR, he personally admits

605
00:25:56.525 --> 00:25:59.045
that he dismissed it thinking it couldn't possibly be

606
00:25:59.045 --> 00:26:01.285
helpful because he was coming from a training

607
00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:04.365
that lacks deeper understanding about what's really

608
00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:07.805
happening in the deeper levels of the body Mind system.

609
00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:10.805
Because of this disconnection from the deeper wisdom,

610
00:26:10.805 --> 00:26:14.005
western medicine, western culture has had

611
00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.405
to just take this hit

612
00:26:15.425 --> 00:26:17.885
or miss approach trying to find solutions and

613
00:26:17.885 --> 00:26:19.885
therefore getting hit or miss results.

614
00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:23.845
Instead, in subtle body work coming from ancient

615
00:26:23.845 --> 00:26:26.245
understandings, we are taking the positive aspects

616
00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:27.445
of things like somatic therapy,

617
00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:31.285
but we're integrating ancient eastern wisdom traditions

618
00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:34.045
that have preserved the understanding of how the body,

619
00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:36.845
soul emotions and minds seamlessly fit together

620
00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:38.285
and influence each other.

621
00:26:38.475 --> 00:26:40.885
It's not random. There is actually a way that it works.

622
00:26:41.665 --> 00:26:45.525
So to go back to my deeper EMDR example,

623
00:26:45.555 --> 00:26:46.805
this modality can be helpful,

624
00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:50.085
but it's working with one small aspect of

625
00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:51.925
how trauma may have encoded

626
00:26:52.145 --> 00:26:54.845
and generally doesn't get the entire source of the problem.

627
00:26:55.465 --> 00:26:57.405
And you might be thinking, I'm going

628
00:26:57.405 --> 00:26:59.285
to recommend breath work or psychedelics.

629
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:03.365
Well surprise, I generally do not recommend these roots if

630
00:27:03.365 --> 00:27:04.845
you are a sensitive empathic person.

631
00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:07.725
Now again, they can also be helpful if you've done those

632
00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:09.285
things and gotten benefit, that's great,

633
00:27:09.465 --> 00:27:12.645
but while those methods can be needed, especially for

634
00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:15.605
what I would call sort of normal people with zero access

635
00:27:15.665 --> 00:27:18.645
to their inner experience, those type

636
00:27:18.645 --> 00:27:20.365
of modalities like breath work

637
00:27:20.465 --> 00:27:23.245
and using uh, controlled psychedelics, they kind

638
00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:24.325
of bust the door down.

639
00:27:24.905 --> 00:27:27.845
And if you are an empathic sensitive person doing

640
00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:28.965
that strong breath work

641
00:27:29.225 --> 00:27:30.365
or using substances,

642
00:27:30.385 --> 00:27:32.725
it can actually be very stressful for your subtle body.

643
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:36.125
It will crack things open against your body's innate wisdom

644
00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:39.765
and tie line and it will often come up in a way

645
00:27:39.765 --> 00:27:41.845
that's overwhelming and hard to integrate

646
00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:45.645
and it doesn't give you the skills to master the things

647
00:27:45.645 --> 00:27:46.765
that will come up in the future.

648
00:27:46.995 --> 00:27:48.005
It's a one-time thing.

649
00:27:49.005 --> 00:27:50.145
The truth is, is that

650
00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.585
what we understand in subtle body work, which is what I

651
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:57.225
the subtle body, is a term to sort of talk about

652
00:27:57.765 --> 00:28:00.905
not just all of the layers of the mind, body, spirit system,

653
00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:02.585
but also the way that they fit together.

654
00:28:03.485 --> 00:28:07.625
Subtle body has a, each part has a different technical area

655
00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:11.225
that operate and interact with each other in specific ways.

656
00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:13.865
Unfortunately, this um, you know, sort of western

657
00:28:13.965 --> 00:28:16.945
and medicine and conventional therapy aren't in touch

658
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:20.185
with this wisdom and even some natural health modalities are

659
00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:22.785
just centered on one aspect of the system.

660
00:28:23.365 --> 00:28:25.785
So what's really needed in trauma healing is

661
00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:29.505
to understand the big picture as we do in subtle body work

662
00:28:29.965 --> 00:28:31.785
so that we can heal the system

663
00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:33.545
as a whole and release the trauma.

664
00:28:34.365 --> 00:28:37.415
Another area you'll hear people talk about in the trauma

665
00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:38.975
healing world is the nervous system.

666
00:28:39.115 --> 00:28:40.375
You'll hear therapists

667
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.415
and coaches say that calming your nervous system

668
00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:43.655
is the key to healing trauma.

669
00:28:44.115 --> 00:28:47.535
Yes, your nervous system and your vagus nerve are important

670
00:28:47.755 --> 00:28:50.735
and they are still only one component of your

671
00:28:51.335 --> 00:28:52.895
complete body mind system.

672
00:28:53.405 --> 00:28:56.455
They are still more surface and you're reacting to what's

673
00:28:56.555 --> 00:28:58.895
and those parts of your system are reacting to what's

674
00:28:58.895 --> 00:29:01.655
underneath rather than just like getting

675
00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:02.775
to the deeper source of it.

676
00:29:03.595 --> 00:29:06.255
If you think about this, everything is interconnected.

677
00:29:06.255 --> 00:29:08.135
Nervous systems don't just magically

678
00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:10.015
dysregulate themselves in a vacuum.

679
00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:14.055
Their dysregulation is a response to something deeper

680
00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:16.335
that came first in the subtle body layers

681
00:29:16.645 --> 00:29:18.015
that is not being addressed

682
00:29:18.015 --> 00:29:20.175
by simply calming the nervous system response.

683
00:29:20.955 --> 00:29:23.975
So using a focus on regulating your nervous system

684
00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:27.055
as your main approach to trauma is like trying

685
00:29:27.055 --> 00:29:29.255
to keep the dandelions out of your front yard

686
00:29:29.475 --> 00:29:31.095
by just going out every day

687
00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:32.375
and picking the flowers off

688
00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:33.935
of the dandelions that have come up.

689
00:29:34.595 --> 00:29:37.695
It might look a little calmer on the surface for that day,

690
00:29:38.355 --> 00:29:40.095
but what happens when you walk

691
00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:42.485
outside the next morning more dandelions.

692
00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:45.125
So doing eye movements

693
00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:48.005
and alternate body tapping till the cows come home.

694
00:29:48.005 --> 00:29:50.885
It like it might take the edge off your level of reaction,

695
00:29:50.885 --> 00:29:53.125
but it doesn't prevent it from coming back in the future.

696
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:57.045
What is really needed is to deal with the entire wiring

697
00:29:57.045 --> 00:30:00.725
of the body mind system to actually remove the root

698
00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:03.005
of the dandelions so that they don't come back.

699
00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:05.405
Now I'm an herbalist and dandelions are good

700
00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:06.605
medicine, but it's just an analogy.

701
00:30:07.565 --> 00:30:09.845
I want you to just imagine not even having

702
00:30:09.985 --> 00:30:12.045
to check your front yard at all

703
00:30:12.045 --> 00:30:14.365
because we've actually changed the landscape.

704
00:30:14.515 --> 00:30:16.365
When you've dealt with issues at the root,

705
00:30:16.705 --> 00:30:18.325
you can actually just go on

706
00:30:18.325 --> 00:30:20.405
to focusing in about other things

707
00:30:20.405 --> 00:30:21.845
that you love in your life instead

708
00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:23.205
of constantly worrying about your lawn.

709
00:30:23.205 --> 00:30:24.325
That's what we're going for.

710
00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:27.925
You become able to do things that you couldn't do before

711
00:30:28.545 --> 00:30:31.125
and the trauma habits, like the coping skills

712
00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:33.085
that you couldn't stop yourself from doing

713
00:30:33.085 --> 00:30:34.845
before, even though you knew they were bad

714
00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:36.925
for you just naturally fall away

715
00:30:36.925 --> 00:30:38.445
because the landscape is different.

716
00:30:39.995 --> 00:30:42.685
This is a a subtle body graduate ssk

717
00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:46.805
and she kind of is noticed this in her own life especially,

718
00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:49.765
um, with going on trips was one of the things she noticed.

719
00:30:50.225 --> 00:30:52.005
She said, until I encountered this kind of work,

720
00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:53.165
it didn't even occur to me

721
00:30:53.165 --> 00:30:54.965
that I could actually dissolve triggers.

722
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.445
I've always been triggered by preparing for a trip,

723
00:30:57.465 --> 00:30:59.125
my body gets tense, I get snippy

724
00:30:59.305 --> 00:31:00.805
and I recently took a trip to the beach

725
00:31:00.805 --> 00:31:03.525
and it was easy, easy to pack, easy to get ready,

726
00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:06.525
actually drove and it was easy and even my husband noticed

727
00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:08.685
and was like, wow, I didn't even know what this was like.

728
00:31:10.225 --> 00:31:14.045
So you also wanna watch in this level of you want

729
00:31:14.045 --> 00:31:17.325
to watch out for a common healer mindset trap that comes up

730
00:31:17.395 --> 00:31:21.045
that says something like, well my trauma makes me who I am

731
00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:23.565
and it's how I empathize and help people

732
00:31:23.565 --> 00:31:25.205
because I know what they're going through.

733
00:31:25.865 --> 00:31:27.925
Now if this is you, let's just look at that for a minute.

734
00:31:28.145 --> 00:31:31.725
If you have cancer per se, you don't go looking for a doctor

735
00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:34.685
that has cancer because they've done it,

736
00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:35.885
had it themselves to help you.

737
00:31:35.985 --> 00:31:37.645
That's probably not even on the list

738
00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:39.325
of qualities that you look for.

739
00:31:40.145 --> 00:31:41.165
So the heart

740
00:31:41.265 --> 00:31:44.325
and soul level of your subtle body is how you connect

741
00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:46.405
with others via compassion and understanding

742
00:31:46.465 --> 00:31:47.605
and presence, not

743
00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.885
by having the same trauma vibe to match up with them.

744
00:31:50.985 --> 00:31:52.125
The more healed

745
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:55.485
and functional your subtle body system is, the more

746
00:31:55.485 --> 00:31:58.645
of a shining healing conduit you can be to influence others.

747
00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:01.725
So you don't need to be perfectly healed in order

748
00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:04.245
to start helping others, but just like on a plane,

749
00:32:04.385 --> 00:32:06.285
you do need to put your oxygen mask on first

750
00:32:06.285 --> 00:32:07.525
before you're gonna help other people.

751
00:32:08.105 --> 00:32:11.565
So if you're called to do deeper healing work with others,

752
00:32:11.565 --> 00:32:14.365
understanding this foundational subtle body level in

753
00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:16.805
yourself is the gateway to being a healer

754
00:32:16.805 --> 00:32:17.885
that truly makes a difference.

755
00:32:19.235 --> 00:32:21.615
You might also think I'm going to reveal some

756
00:32:22.155 --> 00:32:24.815
one trick fixes, all energy medicine technique

757
00:32:24.815 --> 00:32:26.575
where I run magnets over your meridians

758
00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:30.175
or I tap your fingers or just use muscle testing while doing

759
00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:32.135
positive statements or doing energy medicine

760
00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:33.215
and grounding techniques.

761
00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:36.535
I'm gonna surprise you again because that's not it.

762
00:32:36.915 --> 00:32:38.375
Energy medicine again is helpful

763
00:32:38.555 --> 00:32:41.725
but it's only touching on a part of the mind body system

764
00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:44.605
and it's often deactivated the efforts.

765
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:48.525
The good efforts of energy work are often overrun

766
00:32:48.545 --> 00:32:49.565
and deactivated by

767
00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:52.005
what we call in subtle body work are protector systems,

768
00:32:52.005 --> 00:32:53.525
which we're gonna talk about more in a minute.

769
00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:57.205
So part of the problem with energy medicine techniques is

770
00:32:57.205 --> 00:32:59.965
that its emphasis is on what you feel in the moment.

771
00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:03.845
Without a larger tracking of outer world results,

772
00:33:03.945 --> 00:33:05.885
you might feel energy moving in the moment,

773
00:33:05.985 --> 00:33:09.685
but things moving in the moment doesn't necessarily mean

774
00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:11.685
that you're actually changing the wiring.

775
00:33:11.835 --> 00:33:13.645
It's a feeling in a sensation yes,

776
00:33:13.665 --> 00:33:16.645
but you have to be able to still use it in the context

777
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.925
of what's really happening in the entire system

778
00:33:19.555 --> 00:33:21.125
when it comes to actual deep

779
00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:24.165
and lasting healing that moves you into a new era

780
00:33:24.345 --> 00:33:28.365
of your purposeful anxiety-free soul aligned life trying

781
00:33:28.365 --> 00:33:29.725
to get there with a closet full

782
00:33:29.745 --> 00:33:31.405
of little specific modalities

783
00:33:31.405 --> 00:33:34.405
that only focus on one small aspect is going

784
00:33:34.405 --> 00:33:36.845
to just keep you on the healing hamster wheel

785
00:33:36.845 --> 00:33:39.965
where you're always collecting modalities rather than

786
00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:41.845
actual in your life results.

787
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:45.565
And the longer that you're on the healing hamster wheel

788
00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:46.685
turning and turning

789
00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:49.325
but not really moving forward, the worse it gets.

790
00:33:49.745 --> 00:33:51.925
That's where you start to feel desperate

791
00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.445
and worry that you're broken

792
00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:56.405
and imposter syndrome starts to set in.

793
00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:59.485
You feel shame kind of creeping in underneath.

794
00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:03.125
You need a comprehensive system based on a clear

795
00:34:03.225 --> 00:34:05.405
and technical understanding of the subtle body,

796
00:34:05.655 --> 00:34:08.445
which is all aspects of the mind, body, spirit system

797
00:34:08.705 --> 00:34:11.645
and how they function together and interconnect.

798
00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:14.565
You need a comprehensive system that is practical

799
00:34:14.825 --> 00:34:16.765
and can be implemented in your daily life,

800
00:34:16.905 --> 00:34:18.685
not just some theory or conceptual

801
00:34:18.775 --> 00:34:20.125
ideas that stay in your head.

802
00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:23.845
I'm guessing you're seeing kind of how crazy it is to think

803
00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:25.845
that approaches that only target the mind

804
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:27.445
or only target the energy

805
00:34:27.905 --> 00:34:31.485
of the body can like somehow magically make changes at all

806
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:33.165
the levels of your mind body system.

807
00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:35.645
Instead, here's what you're going to do.

808
00:34:35.985 --> 00:34:38.165
You're going to release the old trauma

809
00:34:38.225 --> 00:34:41.405
and patterns trapped in your subtle body while getting

810
00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:44.205
to the hidden source of the anxiety, the self-sabotage

811
00:34:44.205 --> 00:34:46.565
and sense of unworthiness that's been holding you back

812
00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:50.365
by reconnecting the parts of your body, mind, spirit system

813
00:34:50.365 --> 00:34:53.045
that have gotten separated, decoding the language

814
00:34:53.045 --> 00:34:56.525
that your subtle body has been using, tracing the issue

815
00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:57.565
to its true source

816
00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:59.485
and repairing the pathway so

817
00:34:59.485 --> 00:35:01.605
that the trauma can get all the way out.

818
00:35:02.145 --> 00:35:04.725
And this is also why the Body Wisdom Academy trauma

819
00:35:04.755 --> 00:35:08.245
releasing system isn't just about the inner healing process,

820
00:35:08.415 --> 00:35:10.205
which is incredibly effective

821
00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.245
and unlike anything else anyone is doing,

822
00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:15.925
but it's also about how we then take that healing

823
00:35:16.145 --> 00:35:18.845
and systematically integrate it into the

824
00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:20.165
outer areas of your life.

825
00:35:20.825 --> 00:35:24.525
You are going to understand how to energetically communicate

826
00:35:24.585 --> 00:35:26.165
and develop healthy boundaries

827
00:35:26.515 --> 00:35:29.405
that feel caring at the same time so

828
00:35:29.835 --> 00:35:32.965
that you can stop taking on other people's energy

829
00:35:33.145 --> 00:35:36.045
and attract ideal personal and romantic relationships.

830
00:35:36.665 --> 00:35:39.845
We dig deep into reorganizing your family geometry

831
00:35:39.905 --> 00:35:41.565
so you can contribute to the healing

832
00:35:41.585 --> 00:35:43.805
of your family lineage while getting rid

833
00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:44.885
of generational baggage

834
00:35:45.305 --> 00:35:47.605
so it doesn't go forward into the next generation.

835
00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:51.435
Okay, let's transition here to secret number two.

836
00:35:52.315 --> 00:35:55.155
Learning the code to deactivate your triggers in the moment

837
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:57.315
so that you can dissolve them instead

838
00:35:57.315 --> 00:35:58.795
of constantly managing them.

839
00:35:59.895 --> 00:36:02.675
Now we've already been talking about the most common things

840
00:36:02.695 --> 00:36:04.515
you hear from the therapy authority

841
00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:07.355
and other modality approaches to releasing trauma.

842
00:36:08.295 --> 00:36:10.635
Now let's look at that in the context to

843
00:36:10.855 --> 00:36:12.835
how we're actually wired on a subtle body

844
00:36:12.895 --> 00:36:14.435
or mind body, spirit level.

845
00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:16.955
So here's a little diagram.

846
00:36:17.445 --> 00:36:20.315
Let's imagine that the different layers of your mind, body,

847
00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:23.355
spirit, or your subtle body system are represented

848
00:36:23.455 --> 00:36:25.675
by these discs sort of at these different levels.

849
00:36:26.615 --> 00:36:31.395
And not only are the discs, um, have each have sort

850
00:36:31.395 --> 00:36:34.475
of these different layers, but they also deeply interact

851
00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:36.195
with each other and have interconnection.

852
00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:40.355
Now you can see, you can imagine that in the way each

853
00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:43.555
of these function, they each have these little sort

854
00:36:43.555 --> 00:36:45.835
of aligned little notches, little spaces.

855
00:36:46.095 --> 00:36:48.755
And you can notice that in general those are all at

856
00:36:48.755 --> 00:36:50.875
different places because different levels

857
00:36:51.095 --> 00:36:53.835
of the subtle body function in different ways.

858
00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:57.395
And here you can see the trauma that gets slur

859
00:36:57.395 --> 00:37:00.075
of lodged in our system when we go through a traumatic event

860
00:37:00.075 --> 00:37:02.795
because our body is trying to protect us

861
00:37:02.795 --> 00:37:06.395
because it, the thing that happened was overwhelming

862
00:37:06.395 --> 00:37:08.635
to our system in a very basic sense.

863
00:37:08.735 --> 00:37:13.275
Trauma is any time that our sense of safety got overwhelmed

864
00:37:13.295 --> 00:37:16.475
or or was over capacitated our subtle body system.

865
00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:20.875
So in order to preserve the the whole wholeness

866
00:37:20.875 --> 00:37:23.115
of our organism, the body will sort of entrap

867
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.715
and sequester the trauma, which is a good idea at the time,

868
00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:27.875
but ends up gumming up the system.

869
00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:30.435
So here you can sort of see that the trauma is sort

870
00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:32.035
of trapped in these different layers.

871
00:37:32.865 --> 00:37:34.075
It's trapped also

872
00:37:34.075 --> 00:37:37.875
because of the way that those gaps, those notches in each

873
00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:39.755
of the layer discs are not aligned.

874
00:37:40.655 --> 00:37:43.395
So what we have to do in subtle body work,

875
00:37:43.705 --> 00:37:48.075
what we're doing is we're actually using a holistic

876
00:37:48.715 --> 00:37:50.835
systemic process to heal

877
00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:52.875
and align the interconnection so

878
00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:55.155
that the trauma can actually get all the way out.

879
00:37:55.295 --> 00:37:57.075
You have to deal with all aspects

880
00:37:57.535 --> 00:37:59.595
of the subtle body at the same time

881
00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:02.275
and in the right ways for each level for

882
00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:05.595
to actually align those notches in the disc so

883
00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:07.755
that the trauma can actually get out for good instead

884
00:38:07.755 --> 00:38:09.235
of just kind of swishing it

885
00:38:09.235 --> 00:38:10.675
around at the level where it's stuck.

886
00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:15.555
So in subtle body work we use a five step framework

887
00:38:15.665 --> 00:38:17.555
that helps you release the trauma

888
00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.235
and wounding trapped in your body.

889
00:38:19.535 --> 00:38:22.955
The first phase is to stop the spiral.

890
00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:25.515
This is very important

891
00:38:25.515 --> 00:38:27.675
because we need to start speaking the language so

892
00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:29.715
that the body can actually change

893
00:38:29.815 --> 00:38:31.035
the sensation in the moment.

894
00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:34.795
This is where I see clients say all the time, whoa,

895
00:38:35.265 --> 00:38:37.205
I'm actually catching myself leaving my body

896
00:38:37.225 --> 00:38:39.685
and I'm staying with myself and feeling more calm.

897
00:38:40.265 --> 00:38:43.165
Or I used to get triggered for days in this situation

898
00:38:43.165 --> 00:38:45.165
and now I notice the trigger, I apply the tools

899
00:38:45.165 --> 00:38:46.205
and I come back to myself.

900
00:38:46.705 --> 00:38:49.565
Now ultimately we are going to erase the source

901
00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:50.845
of the trigger entirely

902
00:38:51.025 --> 00:38:53.085
so you don't even get triggered in the first place.

903
00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:55.925
But we have to start with stopping the spiral

904
00:38:55.995 --> 00:38:57.005
that happens in the body

905
00:38:57.005 --> 00:38:58.965
because that's stressful for the subtle body

906
00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:02.125
and that in itself is super valuable no matter what.

907
00:39:02.515 --> 00:39:04.925
This stage really greatly reduces the time

908
00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:06.565
that you spend getting triggered

909
00:39:06.565 --> 00:39:08.805
and spun out by other people or by world events

910
00:39:09.225 --> 00:39:10.405
and it really makes panic

911
00:39:10.505 --> 00:39:12.685
and anxiety attacks, uh, a thing of the past.

912
00:39:13.305 --> 00:39:17.725
The next phase is that we reconnect, we need to

913
00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:21.525
heal the interconnections of the subtle body pathways.

914
00:39:22.075 --> 00:39:24.605
This involves things like the heart to pelvis connection,

915
00:39:24.605 --> 00:39:26.245
the different levels of the heart dealing

916
00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:27.525
with our heart protector.

917
00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:30.325
These are all details about how the different levels

918
00:39:30.385 --> 00:39:33.325
of the discs or the subtle body work that need

919
00:39:33.325 --> 00:39:35.485
to reestablish their connection with the whole.

920
00:39:35.555 --> 00:39:38.685
Because not only when trauma gets trapped in the system,

921
00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:42.005
in order to compensate for that, the body will sort of, uh,

922
00:39:42.115 --> 00:39:44.405
sequester or disconnect parts of the body

923
00:39:44.405 --> 00:39:45.685
and we need to bring those back together

924
00:39:45.745 --> 00:39:47.525
to restore holistic function.

925
00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:51.145
And the next phase we find the source.

926
00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.825
This is where you really learn

927
00:39:52.925 --> 00:39:56.505
to trace the surface triggers down to the deeper issues in

928
00:39:56.505 --> 00:39:57.545
what we call the basement.

929
00:39:58.045 --> 00:40:01.305
So one of the things that we know is that we are always

930
00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:03.785
reacting to the past, to the trauma, to things

931
00:40:03.785 --> 00:40:05.185
that aren't there, but it's not logical.

932
00:40:05.325 --> 00:40:08.345
So this is a really important phase for understanding

933
00:40:08.525 --> 00:40:11.265
and really having the, the control seat,

934
00:40:11.285 --> 00:40:15.225
the empowerment in any situation to actually find the source

935
00:40:15.245 --> 00:40:16.905
and get that out of your system for good.

936
00:40:18.055 --> 00:40:20.105
Next phase we activate and release.

937
00:40:20.255 --> 00:40:22.665
This is like the diagram we we showed.

938
00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:25.945
This is where we really learn how the technical side of all

939
00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:28.265
of the parts of the body mind system function

940
00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:30.745
and we learn how to align those discs so

941
00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:32.665
that whatever's coming up can just come up

942
00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:34.665
and come all the way out and be released.

943
00:40:35.255 --> 00:40:37.785
Then we recheck and we enjoy.

944
00:40:37.895 --> 00:40:39.665
This is where we judge by results.

945
00:40:39.805 --> 00:40:42.785
We notice we go on living our life in the outer world

946
00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:44.665
and we notice how the results are there

947
00:40:44.785 --> 00:40:47.185
and things have changed and it's

948
00:40:47.805 --> 00:40:51.225
not logical even though our mind tells us that we need

949
00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:52.705
to work on something very directly.

950
00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:55.105
But the truth is we need to work on what's actually

951
00:40:55.105 --> 00:40:56.825
underneath and the things on the surface

952
00:40:56.855 --> 00:40:58.105
will get better by themselves.

953
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.265
So this is the fun part of recheck and enjoy

954
00:41:00.485 --> 00:41:03.705
and noticing how you are actually naturally

955
00:41:03.705 --> 00:41:04.825
getting different results.

956
00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:09.865
So I want you to really see what this means for you is

957
00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:13.065
that from now on instead of managing your symptoms,

958
00:41:13.605 --> 00:41:15.945
you know exactly how to get to the source

959
00:41:16.165 --> 00:41:18.425
and release it in a matter of minutes so

960
00:41:18.425 --> 00:41:19.465
that you feel lighter

961
00:41:19.605 --> 00:41:21.905
and have a sense of happiness and relief.

962
00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:23.345
I often hear people say, wow,

963
00:41:23.505 --> 00:41:25.545
I just feel like physically lighter.

964
00:41:26.285 --> 00:41:28.145
So no more spiraling thoughts

965
00:41:28.205 --> 00:41:29.945
or triggers that last for days.

966
00:41:30.445 --> 00:41:33.025
And it also helps you build true inner confidence

967
00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:35.445
so there's no more second guessing yourself.

968
00:41:36.605 --> 00:41:39.245
Remember that I have been doing this for a very long time

969
00:41:39.385 --> 00:41:41.605
and I'm familiar with almost any healing

970
00:41:41.605 --> 00:41:42.805
modality you can name.

971
00:41:43.065 --> 00:41:45.965
And I've been getting clients results even when everything

972
00:41:45.965 --> 00:41:47.805
else they've tried hasn't worked.

973
00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:51.285
Believe me, even if you are a professional healer

974
00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:53.325
or therapist and you're thinking, Hmm,

975
00:41:53.675 --> 00:41:56.205
this really gonna be any different than something I've done

976
00:41:56.205 --> 00:41:59.045
before, remember that I've already helped hundreds

977
00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:01.245
of trained therapists, healers and coaches,

978
00:42:01.905 --> 00:42:04.285
and what I consistently hear them say is, wow,

979
00:42:04.435 --> 00:42:06.165
this is deeper, faster

980
00:42:06.345 --> 00:42:08.645
and fills in the gaps of what I was missing.

981
00:42:08.865 --> 00:42:10.285
So now I know what it's like

982
00:42:10.305 --> 00:42:12.245
to actually get lasting results.

983
00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:16.735
And if you're saying to yourself, yeah,

984
00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:18.775
but I always start strong

985
00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:20.575
but then I drop off with these kinds of things.

986
00:42:20.785 --> 00:42:22.855
Great news, nobody is meant to do this kind

987
00:42:22.855 --> 00:42:24.015
of deep healing work alone.

988
00:42:24.085 --> 00:42:26.895
Even the best, most effective healers in the world need

989
00:42:26.895 --> 00:42:28.175
personalized mentorship

990
00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:30.495
and a guide to truly build lasting skill.

991
00:42:30.595 --> 00:42:32.175
So if that's where you are, great news,

992
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:34.175
you're in good company, the truth is

993
00:42:34.175 --> 00:42:36.335
that this system can be taught

994
00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:39.335
and more importantly learned in an embodied way.

995
00:42:39.405 --> 00:42:41.215
When you have actual personalized coaching

996
00:42:41.215 --> 00:42:43.735
and guidance, it's just a matter of following the steps

997
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:46.055
and getting feedback for your situation.

998
00:42:46.635 --> 00:42:48.855
So if you've struggled before, it's only

999
00:42:48.855 --> 00:42:51.055
because you only had part of the picture

1000
00:42:51.595 --> 00:42:53.255
and no one there to personally help

1001
00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:54.335
you through the blind spots.

1002
00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:58.055
You haven't had a subtle body expert there by your side

1003
00:42:58.115 --> 00:43:00.895
to turn the blind spots into the breakthroughs.

1004
00:43:01.635 --> 00:43:03.575
The truth of the matter is that your mind, body,

1005
00:43:03.575 --> 00:43:07.815
spirit system, the wiring of your subtle body is not random.

1006
00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:10.535
It has very specific defined

1007
00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:12.175
and predictable ways of working.

1008
00:43:12.435 --> 00:43:14.655
It acts in certain ways when it's running smoothly

1009
00:43:15.075 --> 00:43:17.855
and in different ways when it's having problems.

1010
00:43:17.955 --> 00:43:20.375
And those things leave signs that we understand.

1011
00:43:20.995 --> 00:43:22.135
And the longer you wait

1012
00:43:22.155 --> 00:43:25.215
and leave these old stuck trauma patterns running in your

1013
00:43:25.215 --> 00:43:26.415
system, the worse it gets.

1014
00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:28.295
Trauma is contagious.

1015
00:43:28.995 --> 00:43:31.415
You will pass it on to your children to the people

1016
00:43:31.415 --> 00:43:33.295
that you're around and in relationship with.

1017
00:43:33.835 --> 00:43:37.255
And as much as we think we want to get over our trauma,

1018
00:43:37.285 --> 00:43:40.455
there's also a part of you that is totally freaked out

1019
00:43:40.455 --> 00:43:41.775
by the idea of getting better.

1020
00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:46.055
I know that sounds weird, but this is your protector system.

1021
00:43:46.685 --> 00:43:49.375
This is usually happening outside of the level

1022
00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:50.375
of our conscious mind,

1023
00:43:50.675 --> 00:43:52.415
but it's a huge barrier in healing

1024
00:43:52.445 --> 00:43:53.935
that most modalities miss.

1025
00:43:54.795 --> 00:43:59.215
So for real healing, you need to align all of the discs

1026
00:43:59.215 --> 00:44:01.015
and deal with all appropriate aspects

1027
00:44:01.015 --> 00:44:02.775
of the subtle body simultaneously.

1028
00:44:03.715 --> 00:44:07.375
And you also need to combine that with a systematic approach

1029
00:44:07.795 --> 00:44:10.415
to dealing with what we call the protector system

1030
00:44:11.275 --> 00:44:13.055
who will be, this is the part of yourself

1031
00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:14.655
that will be putting up resistance

1032
00:44:14.675 --> 00:44:17.255
and trying to block the way as you start to go down

1033
00:44:17.255 --> 00:44:18.415
to deeper healing levels.

1034
00:44:19.515 --> 00:44:21.175
Now is that tricky? Yeah.

1035
00:44:21.275 --> 00:44:23.055
And that's why most people aren't doing it.

1036
00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:25.415
They haven't figured out how, which is of course

1037
00:44:25.415 --> 00:44:29.055
where the subtle body work in the Body Wisdom Academy trauma

1038
00:44:29.055 --> 00:44:30.535
release system comes in.

1039
00:44:31.395 --> 00:44:34.525
Okay, let's talk about the protector system in secret number

1040
00:44:34.525 --> 00:44:37.285
three, how to overcome imposter syndrome

1041
00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:40.725
and self-sabotage once and for all and actually feel worthy

1042
00:44:40.745 --> 00:44:41.845
and aligned with your purpose.

1043
00:44:42.945 --> 00:44:44.565
Now, many years ago now,

1044
00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:47.965
I was attending my first big women's business conference.

1045
00:44:48.075 --> 00:44:50.245
Imagine a thousand people,

1046
00:44:50.245 --> 00:44:52.525
mostly women from all over North America

1047
00:44:53.185 --> 00:44:54.765
at all stages of business.

1048
00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:57.485
Packed into this hotel conference center in the middle

1049
00:44:57.485 --> 00:44:58.525
of summer in Dallas.

1050
00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:00.965
It was hot and one

1051
00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:04.245
of the bigwig speakers at the conference was Hiram w Smith.

1052
00:45:04.385 --> 00:45:05.885
Now if you're not familiar with Hiram,

1053
00:45:05.885 --> 00:45:08.605
he was a major player in the field of productivity

1054
00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:09.805
and personal development.

1055
00:45:10.025 --> 00:45:12.165
He wrote a book called The 10 Natural Laws

1056
00:45:12.265 --> 00:45:14.365
of Successful Time in Life Management.

1057
00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:16.605
He built an influential company in the eighties

1058
00:45:16.605 --> 00:45:19.045
that eventually merged and became Franklin Covey,

1059
00:45:19.045 --> 00:45:20.525
which was started by Stephen Covey

1060
00:45:20.705 --> 00:45:22.485
who wrote the Well-known book, the Seven Habits

1061
00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:23.645
of Highly Effective People.

1062
00:45:24.025 --> 00:45:27.285
So we're talking about a guy who literally wrote the book on

1063
00:45:27.285 --> 00:45:29.085
how to be an effective person in your life.

1064
00:45:29.705 --> 00:45:32.285
And Hiram was a pretty dynamic guy and speaker.

1065
00:45:32.285 --> 00:45:34.045
During the course of his talks,

1066
00:45:34.425 --> 00:45:36.285
he made us all memorize some lines from

1067
00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:37.765
Shakespeare with hand motions.

1068
00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:39.325
And he had a pretty strong kind

1069
00:45:39.325 --> 00:45:40.765
of old school vibe and way about him.

1070
00:45:40.865 --> 00:45:43.645
And although he didn't really say it super directly was also

1071
00:45:43.645 --> 00:45:45.885
pretty clear that his spiritual beliefs were

1072
00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:47.205
very central to his life.

1073
00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:51.165
And as is sometimes the case with these uh, conferences,

1074
00:45:51.275 --> 00:45:53.605
many of the speakers stuck around at the end

1075
00:45:53.605 --> 00:45:55.925
of the conference in between their presentations.

1076
00:45:56.385 --> 00:45:58.045
And although I was kind of nervous,

1077
00:45:58.445 --> 00:46:01.045
I was like a new young business owner, I challenged myself

1078
00:46:01.045 --> 00:46:05.485
to go and talk with him and we did a few minutes of chitchat

1079
00:46:05.485 --> 00:46:07.765
and I eventually got up the nerve to ask him a question

1080
00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:12.485
and I asked him, if you had to choose one thing,

1081
00:46:12.795 --> 00:46:14.805
what would you say is the hardest part of your job?

1082
00:46:15.465 --> 00:46:18.565
And you know what he said, he did not hesitate.

1083
00:46:18.625 --> 00:46:19.765
He answered very clearly

1084
00:46:19.945 --> 00:46:23.405
and he said, well, the hardest part for me is that

1085
00:46:23.425 --> 00:46:26.885
for some people I can give them everything they

1086
00:46:26.885 --> 00:46:27.925
need to be successful.

1087
00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:31.645
I can lay out the steps clearly and simply one by one

1088
00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:35.845
and some people will still not do it.

1089
00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:37.925
And I can't understand why that is.

1090
00:46:37.925 --> 00:46:40.365
That's the most frustrating thing.

1091
00:46:42.205 --> 00:46:45.535
What this smart successful man,

1092
00:46:45.885 --> 00:46:49.095
this personal development icon of a person

1093
00:46:49.915 --> 00:46:51.775
saw his clients hitting up against

1094
00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:54.495
that he couldn't get them passed is

1095
00:46:54.495 --> 00:46:57.375
what we know in subtle body work as the protector system.

1096
00:46:58.075 --> 00:47:01.055
And because we specifically understand the workings

1097
00:47:01.055 --> 00:47:03.615
of this mind body, energetic part of ourselves,

1098
00:47:03.755 --> 00:47:05.815
how it works, what the symptoms are,

1099
00:47:05.835 --> 00:47:08.815
and most importantly, how to systemically heal

1100
00:47:08.875 --> 00:47:12.335
and rehab it so that it works for us and not against us.

1101
00:47:12.645 --> 00:47:15.495
Because this knowledge is a part of subtle body

1102
00:47:15.495 --> 00:47:17.775
and trauma release work, we are actually able

1103
00:47:18.055 --> 00:47:20.455
to get people results that even the giants

1104
00:47:20.455 --> 00:47:22.895
of the personal development industry cannot achieve.

1105
00:47:24.035 --> 00:47:27.735
Now, the protector system is a part of ourselves

1106
00:47:27.735 --> 00:47:29.885
that is always trying to protect ourselves

1107
00:47:30.065 --> 00:47:32.285
and just like it sounds like and keep us safe.

1108
00:47:32.585 --> 00:47:36.605
But although its intentions are good in our lives,

1109
00:47:36.785 --> 00:47:39.685
the protector system easily gets bogged down by the past.

1110
00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:42.085
It gets clouded by the big

1111
00:47:42.105 --> 00:47:44.325
and the little traumas that we go through in life

1112
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:47.885
and it's like a switch that gets flipped on

1113
00:47:48.025 --> 00:47:49.525
but never gets flipped off.

1114
00:47:50.545 --> 00:47:54.285
And what ends up happening is it starts sending off alarms

1115
00:47:54.285 --> 00:47:56.805
and sabotaging things in our lives just

1116
00:47:56.805 --> 00:47:58.525
because they seem new or different

1117
00:47:58.525 --> 00:48:01.845
because they're tied incorrectly to things in the past,

1118
00:48:02.195 --> 00:48:04.325
even though these new things could be good for us.

1119
00:48:04.825 --> 00:48:08.245
So here's the important thing to realize in starting

1120
00:48:08.265 --> 00:48:10.645
to heal your protector system responses

1121
00:48:11.185 --> 00:48:12.965
and retrain it from the inside out.

1122
00:48:13.295 --> 00:48:15.005
First is we have to learn how

1123
00:48:15.005 --> 00:48:17.045
to spot an overactive protector system.

1124
00:48:17.105 --> 00:48:18.885
And it's a little sneakier than you might think.

1125
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:23.125
The protector system is wiring in and across

1126
00:48:23.185 --> 00:48:26.885
and between the many aspects of the mind body and the

1127
00:48:27.025 --> 00:48:29.045
and the mind, the layers of the subtle body.

1128
00:48:29.505 --> 00:48:32.685
And the two biggest ways protector system shenanigans show

1129
00:48:32.685 --> 00:48:35.325
up are mind stories and resistance.

1130
00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:37.845
Now, mind stories are pretty easy to understand.

1131
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:41.445
This is when because your protector system got triggered,

1132
00:48:41.475 --> 00:48:43.125
then this usually happens silently

1133
00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:45.205
and unconsciously without us realizing it.

1134
00:48:45.625 --> 00:48:47.245
It will generate mind stories,

1135
00:48:47.255 --> 00:48:50.045
which we will hear usually as thoughts in our head.

1136
00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:51.405
They usually have the vibe

1137
00:48:51.465 --> 00:48:54.965
of being things like telling you about worst case scenarios,

1138
00:48:55.005 --> 00:48:56.845
thinking about how things could go wrong.

1139
00:48:57.315 --> 00:49:00.645
This also encompasses this protector system activation.

1140
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:03.645
What psychology sometimes refers to as the inner critic,

1141
00:49:03.705 --> 00:49:05.765
that's actually just part of the protector system,

1142
00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:06.925
generating mind stories

1143
00:49:06.925 --> 00:49:08.925
that can be healed over time with this work.

1144
00:49:09.145 --> 00:49:10.845
So if you know yourself to have

1145
00:49:10.845 --> 00:49:12.925
what psychology calls a strong inner critic,

1146
00:49:12.955 --> 00:49:14.005
that that can be helped.

1147
00:49:15.105 --> 00:49:17.365
And they usually are centered on fear and worry.

1148
00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:19.845
Now sometimes we can even notice

1149
00:49:19.845 --> 00:49:22.725
that these mind stories are not based on our actual reality,

1150
00:49:23.105 --> 00:49:26.285
but pointing that out logically doesn't really get rid

1151
00:49:26.285 --> 00:49:28.765
of the mind stories because their source is

1152
00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:30.045
deeper than the mind alone.

1153
00:49:30.995 --> 00:49:33.685
Mind stories often trace to ideas

1154
00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:36.405
that we are somehow broken, that we're too much

1155
00:49:36.425 --> 00:49:37.485
or that we're not enough,

1156
00:49:38.025 --> 00:49:40.485
and that if people find out who we really are,

1157
00:49:40.495 --> 00:49:41.845
we'll be abandoned and alone.

1158
00:49:42.225 --> 00:49:44.525
So sometimes it looks that way as you get deeper down.

1159
00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:46.725
The second aspect that's important

1160
00:49:46.785 --> 00:49:49.005
to talk about here is resistance.

1161
00:49:49.215 --> 00:49:52.205
There are two types of resistance, regular resistance

1162
00:49:52.345 --> 00:49:53.365
and sneaky resistance.

1163
00:49:53.585 --> 00:49:55.285
And people are often surprised to learn

1164
00:49:55.555 --> 00:49:59.285
that sneaky resistance has been secretly sabotaging them

1165
00:49:59.285 --> 00:50:00.685
for years without them even knowing it.

1166
00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:03.165
So let's talk about the regular resistance.

1167
00:50:03.235 --> 00:50:04.765
It's often pretty easy to spot.

1168
00:50:04.955 --> 00:50:08.605
It's literally feeling resistance, like you know

1169
00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:11.165
what you need to do, but you actually just don't do it.

1170
00:50:11.165 --> 00:50:14.405
You feel resistant to doing things, you avoid things,

1171
00:50:14.465 --> 00:50:17.725
you procrastinate or you feel angry or frustrated

1172
00:50:18.065 --> 00:50:20.085
or hopeless or scared.

1173
00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:25.125
But sneaky resistance is well kind of sneaky

1174
00:50:25.125 --> 00:50:28.125
and it doesn't even have to be what we would call negative.

1175
00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:30.765
So certain types of brain fog,

1176
00:50:30.825 --> 00:50:33.005
if you've ever felt can signify an

1177
00:50:33.005 --> 00:50:34.365
overactive protector system.

1178
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:36.285
Like all of a sudden you just like can't think,

1179
00:50:37.265 --> 00:50:39.205
you start something

1180
00:50:39.345 --> 00:50:41.165
and you just sort of start forgetting

1181
00:50:41.305 --> 00:50:42.605
to complete it and follow through.

1182
00:50:42.605 --> 00:50:44.885
Maybe you don't feel angry, but you just like kind

1183
00:50:44.885 --> 00:50:48.085
of shiny object syndrome where you're always off

1184
00:50:48.085 --> 00:50:49.885
to the new thing or you're always great at the

1185
00:50:49.885 --> 00:50:51.005
beginning, then you fall off.

1186
00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:55.165
These are protector system resistant strategies.

1187
00:50:56.075 --> 00:50:59.245
They're all signs of that type of sneaky activation.

1188
00:50:59.995 --> 00:51:04.485
Also, the need to constantly stay busy or to be productive.

1189
00:51:04.855 --> 00:51:07.125
These are qualities that society praises,

1190
00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:09.645
but they are often coming from the protector system

1191
00:51:09.945 --> 00:51:12.845
and the anxiety that creates will drain your QE

1192
00:51:12.845 --> 00:51:13.845
and energy over time.

1193
00:51:14.635 --> 00:51:18.325
Some aspects of chronic pain are protector system activation

1194
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:21.405
and resistance, although chronic pain will usually have

1195
00:51:21.415 --> 00:51:25.365
other factors happening at the same time, we often do see

1196
00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:26.485
that these are linked together

1197
00:51:26.505 --> 00:51:27.645
and people with chronic pain,

1198
00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:29.285
in my experience generally have very

1199
00:51:29.285 --> 00:51:30.645
overactive protector systems.

1200
00:51:30.945 --> 00:51:33.765
Now it's important for me to make clear with this one,

1201
00:51:33.765 --> 00:51:36.045
that subtle body work is not medical advice

1202
00:51:36.045 --> 00:51:37.925
and it's not intended to diagnose, cure

1203
00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:39.205
or treat any diseases

1204
00:51:39.465 --> 00:51:40.925
and it's definitely not approved

1205
00:51:40.925 --> 00:51:42.405
by the food and drug administration.

1206
00:51:42.745 --> 00:51:44.805
So that is my official medical disclaimer.

1207
00:51:45.345 --> 00:51:47.485
And I can also tell you from experience

1208
00:51:47.485 --> 00:51:49.485
that we have had BWA clients

1209
00:51:49.755 --> 00:51:52.925
that didn't even tell us they had chronic pain as a part

1210
00:51:52.925 --> 00:51:55.965
of their picture and until like, you know, four

1211
00:51:55.965 --> 00:51:58.685
or five weeks into the training when they saw significant

1212
00:51:59.085 --> 00:52:00.765
reduction in their pain numbers over the

1213
00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:01.925
course of working together.

1214
00:52:02.665 --> 00:52:03.765
So all,

1215
00:52:04.365 --> 00:52:08.805
although another um, sneaky protector system activation

1216
00:52:08.955 --> 00:52:12.045
that I wanna mention, especially that sensitive healer

1217
00:52:12.065 --> 00:52:15.405
and empath types are often surprised to hear is

1218
00:52:16.065 --> 00:52:19.405
if you always feel like you need to know more

1219
00:52:19.505 --> 00:52:20.525
before being ready.

1220
00:52:20.675 --> 00:52:23.765
This is a super common protector system strategy.

1221
00:52:24.945 --> 00:52:27.085
So here's a bold statement.

1222
00:52:27.785 --> 00:52:31.925
Things like perfectionism are actually signs of trap trauma

1223
00:52:32.185 --> 00:52:35.325
and they're linked to hidden feelings of unworthiness

1224
00:52:35.325 --> 00:52:38.285
that the protector system is trying to cover over with

1225
00:52:38.505 --> 00:52:41.525
how we get things right or perfect in the outer world.

1226
00:52:41.545 --> 00:52:45.485
So if, if you notice yourself getting stuck by the paralysis

1227
00:52:45.505 --> 00:52:48.205
of analysis, you might hear your mind saying, yeah,

1228
00:52:48.625 --> 00:52:51.765
but if I didn't have this constant push to do and to go

1229
00:52:51.785 --> 00:52:53.685
and to be, I'd just never get anything done.

1230
00:52:54.305 --> 00:52:56.445
Or maybe your mind story says, yeah,

1231
00:52:56.705 --> 00:52:58.405
but I just have really high standards

1232
00:52:58.405 --> 00:52:59.845
and I just don't wanna be a slacker.

1233
00:53:00.025 --> 00:53:01.525
So it might look like that at the surface.

1234
00:53:02.025 --> 00:53:04.165
But I'm gonna ask you to trust me here

1235
00:53:04.165 --> 00:53:08.125
as a working hypothesis that this is a part

1236
00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:10.445
of protect your system strategy active in your system.

1237
00:53:10.785 --> 00:53:13.845
Now what I also want you to hear is that it is possible

1238
00:53:14.225 --> 00:53:18.565
to keep the productive, helpful parts of our personality

1239
00:53:18.665 --> 00:53:22.205
and adaptations, but without the protector system drain on

1240
00:53:22.205 --> 00:53:25.085
your system protector system productivity

1241
00:53:25.345 --> 00:53:28.805
or quote unquote energy is really false energy

1242
00:53:28.835 --> 00:53:32.245
because it's coming from fear, it's coming from a wound

1243
00:53:32.385 --> 00:53:35.645
and lack in your system that is depleting you on the inside.

1244
00:53:35.675 --> 00:53:38.685
Even if it seems productive on the surface for a period

1245
00:53:38.685 --> 00:53:41.925
of time, it probably feels normal to you

1246
00:53:41.925 --> 00:53:43.925
because you've had it most of your life.

1247
00:53:43.985 --> 00:53:45.565
But that doesn't mean that it's actually good

1248
00:53:45.565 --> 00:53:46.845
for your soul development.

1249
00:53:47.705 --> 00:53:50.565
So it's important to start to catch these sneaky ways

1250
00:53:50.565 --> 00:53:52.885
that your protector system may be getting in the way

1251
00:53:52.905 --> 00:53:54.085
of your actual healing.

1252
00:53:54.745 --> 00:53:56.685
And while having an awesome awareness

1253
00:53:56.745 --> 00:53:58.725
of your own protector system strategies is

1254
00:53:58.725 --> 00:53:59.805
extremely powerful.

1255
00:54:00.665 --> 00:54:02.525
So I want you to start catching those today.

1256
00:54:02.875 --> 00:54:05.125
Just like other parts of the subtle body

1257
00:54:05.125 --> 00:54:06.205
or the mind body system,

1258
00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.965
the protector system cannot simply be updated

1259
00:54:09.025 --> 00:54:11.525
by just quote unquote thinking positive thoughts.

1260
00:54:11.945 --> 00:54:13.725
So this is why you just can't think

1261
00:54:13.725 --> 00:54:14.885
your way out of resistance.

1262
00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:16.845
You actually have to apply the correct subtle body tools.

1263
00:54:17.465 --> 00:54:20.005
You cannot just defeat your protector system

1264
00:54:20.185 --> 00:54:22.725
by quote unquote just pushing through it.

1265
00:54:23.385 --> 00:54:27.605
Oh, but the self gurus say, just set your mind to it.

1266
00:54:27.715 --> 00:54:30.125
Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

1267
00:54:30.315 --> 00:54:32.365
That Nike slogan of Just Do It.

1268
00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:36.085
Well, that might work great for a shoe company slogan

1269
00:54:36.305 --> 00:54:38.525
or for the less than 1% of the world's population

1270
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:39.965
who are professional athletes.

1271
00:54:40.345 --> 00:54:42.965
But I can tell you from my close personal

1272
00:54:42.965 --> 00:54:45.485
and professional experience, it does not work in healing.

1273
00:54:46.305 --> 00:54:47.965
So while some people may get

1274
00:54:47.965 --> 00:54:50.845
what looks like progress from their pushing efforts,

1275
00:54:51.305 --> 00:54:52.725
and this might be you, you may be able

1276
00:54:52.725 --> 00:54:56.125
to force yourself into a new kind of different habit

1277
00:54:56.145 --> 00:54:59.405
for a period of time, a week, a month, maybe even longer.

1278
00:55:00.145 --> 00:55:02.965
But when you're working against the protector system,

1279
00:55:03.065 --> 00:55:04.405
it will always cost you,

1280
00:55:04.465 --> 00:55:06.365
you'll eventually fall back into old habits

1281
00:55:06.665 --> 00:55:08.845
or you'll burn out from overstressing your system

1282
00:55:08.845 --> 00:55:11.045
with issues like adrenal burnout or chronic fatigue.

1283
00:55:12.455 --> 00:55:15.835
If you have old outdated programming in your protector

1284
00:55:15.835 --> 00:55:19.315
system, it will be getting silently activated in the

1285
00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.755
background, and the more you push through it,

1286
00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:24.235
the more it will snap back like a rubber band

1287
00:55:24.255 --> 00:55:25.275
and knock you off track.

1288
00:55:26.175 --> 00:55:28.555
You will eventually end up quitting, getting distracted,

1289
00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:31.755
self-sabotaging, and you feel frustrated and confused

1290
00:55:31.755 --> 00:55:34.435
because you tried what the Self-Help Guru said,

1291
00:55:34.695 --> 00:55:36.995
and it seemed to work magically for other people,

1292
00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:38.475
but it didn't work for you.

1293
00:55:39.175 --> 00:55:40.635
And at this point in the cycle

1294
00:55:41.095 --> 00:55:43.915
of the protect your system activation, your mind comes

1295
00:55:44.015 --> 00:55:46.115
to the logical conclusion of mind stories

1296
00:55:46.345 --> 00:55:48.715
that you're broken, that there's something wrong with you

1297
00:55:48.935 --> 00:55:50.555
and that you're a terrible imposter

1298
00:55:50.555 --> 00:55:52.635
and good things were work for everybody else but you.

1299
00:55:53.935 --> 00:55:56.715
Oh, but the self-help guru say, just change your mind

1300
00:55:56.775 --> 00:55:57.835
and you'll change your life.

1301
00:55:57.865 --> 00:55:59.155
Just think positive thoughts.

1302
00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:00.795
Just visualize the outcome you want.

1303
00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:02.435
You just need to learn to manifest.

1304
00:56:03.105 --> 00:56:06.435
Well, I hope by now you can see that all this fluffy sort

1305
00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:09.675
of stuff sounds positive new agey things

1306
00:56:09.815 --> 00:56:12.715
and at has some merit of thinking positive thoughts,

1307
00:56:12.715 --> 00:56:15.395
but they are missing the critical understanding of

1308
00:56:15.415 --> 00:56:17.475
how the subtle body and its protector system

1309
00:56:17.475 --> 00:56:18.755
components actually work.

1310
00:56:20.275 --> 00:56:23.015
As we can see perfectly from my experience with Hiram,

1311
00:56:23.435 --> 00:56:27.165
it's not as easy as simple mind logical implementation.

1312
00:56:27.385 --> 00:56:29.365
If it were, certainly the giants

1313
00:56:29.365 --> 00:56:31.485
of the self-help world would've figured it out

1314
00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:33.965
and they haven't mind strategies

1315
00:56:34.265 --> 00:56:36.725
and good intentions don't lead to true healing.

1316
00:56:37.605 --> 00:56:40.845
Reconnecting the vital parts of your subtle body system does

1317
00:56:42.205 --> 00:56:43.325
learning how the wiring

1318
00:56:43.325 --> 00:56:45.045
of your mind body system actually works.

1319
00:56:45.645 --> 00:56:48.245
Decoding what the signals mean, tracing things

1320
00:56:48.245 --> 00:56:50.845
to their true source that dissolves the block

1321
00:56:50.955 --> 00:56:53.485
that have been keeping you from who you really are.

1322
00:56:53.545 --> 00:56:55.805
You need to know the difference when the sensations arise,

1323
00:56:55.805 --> 00:56:58.205
what does it mean if there's a sensation to the left

1324
00:56:58.205 --> 00:56:59.845
of my heart versus if there's a sensation

1325
00:56:59.845 --> 00:57:01.445
that comes up in my solar plexus?

1326
00:57:01.445 --> 00:57:03.765
Those are different things coming from your subtle body

1327
00:57:04.385 --> 00:57:07.045
and processing things mentally in therapy gives you mental

1328
00:57:07.045 --> 00:57:09.885
understanding that makes you go, oh yeah, right.

1329
00:57:09.955 --> 00:57:11.925
That makes sense because my parents were like that.

1330
00:57:11.925 --> 00:57:13.045
This is why I think that way.

1331
00:57:13.705 --> 00:57:15.485
But applying subtle body work

1332
00:57:15.485 --> 00:57:17.325
to change your sensations in the moment

1333
00:57:17.425 --> 00:57:20.285
and release the old trauma from your system makes you go,

1334
00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:23.485
whoa, I actually feel physically lighter right now.

1335
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:24.765
And now that that's gone,

1336
00:57:24.905 --> 00:57:26.645
and this isn't just a feeling in the moment,

1337
00:57:27.185 --> 00:57:28.205
we actually test

1338
00:57:28.305 --> 00:57:30.605
to make sure the changes are holding over time.

1339
00:57:32.745 --> 00:57:36.515
What if I want you to imagine instead of always looking for

1340
00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:40.475
new modalities to fit all these random healing techniques

1341
00:57:40.715 --> 00:57:43.955
together, what if you had one comprehensive system

1342
00:57:43.955 --> 00:57:46.475
that gave you the answers you need to get the results

1343
00:57:46.475 --> 00:57:49.195
that you want, lasting results in your outer life

1344
00:57:49.195 --> 00:57:52.195
with your job, your income with living your purpose,

1345
00:57:52.305 --> 00:57:53.355
with lasting results,

1346
00:57:53.355 --> 00:57:55.875
with getting past all these protector system things

1347
00:57:56.075 --> 00:57:59.235
that I just mentioned deeper, more fulfilling relationships

1348
00:57:59.235 --> 00:58:01.835
with your partner even with difficult family members,

1349
00:58:02.185 --> 00:58:04.555
lasting results with how you feel lighter

1350
00:58:04.655 --> 00:58:06.955
and happier in your physical body and emotions.

1351
00:58:07.615 --> 00:58:10.715
You get the piece of being able to go through the challenges

1352
00:58:10.715 --> 00:58:14.235
of life with soul level confidence that you are aligned

1353
00:58:14.515 --> 00:58:16.755
with your purpose and sharing your gifts no matter

1354
00:58:16.755 --> 00:58:20.815
what comes up, what would it mean for your life right now

1355
00:58:20.995 --> 00:58:23.455
to finally be able to stop doubting yourself

1356
00:58:24.555 --> 00:58:27.335
to clearly see what's yours and what's other people

1357
00:58:27.395 --> 00:58:28.735
and to not be so brought down

1358
00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:30.575
by taking on other people's energy?

1359
00:58:31.085 --> 00:58:33.375
What if you could actually let things go

1360
00:58:34.035 --> 00:58:36.215
and knew the steps on how to do that

1361
00:58:36.215 --> 00:58:37.455
beyond just wishful thinking?

1362
00:58:38.055 --> 00:58:39.695
I heard this directly from one

1363
00:58:39.695 --> 00:58:40.735
of the clients that we worked with.

1364
00:58:40.755 --> 00:58:43.495
She said, I, people always say just let it go,

1365
00:58:43.515 --> 00:58:46.295
but nobody ever taught me how until

1366
00:58:46.975 --> 00:58:48.135
learning the subtle body techniques.

1367
00:58:48.755 --> 00:58:51.855
So imagine the relief to know

1368
00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:55.615
that the generational trauma in your family line gets healed

1369
00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:57.495
with you and isn't being passed on to your children.

1370
00:58:58.565 --> 00:59:00.985
If that sounds like a dream, I can tell you as someone

1371
00:59:01.005 --> 00:59:02.785
who went from being a struggling healer

1372
00:59:02.785 --> 00:59:03.985
with crappy relationships

1373
00:59:04.405 --> 00:59:06.345
to a successful healing business owner,

1374
00:59:06.345 --> 00:59:08.185
serving people living my purpose

1375
00:59:08.775 --> 00:59:10.705
with a better than I thought possible husband

1376
00:59:11.165 --> 00:59:13.505
and a tight-knit circle of awesome female friends

1377
00:59:13.565 --> 00:59:14.705
who really have my back,

1378
00:59:16.215 --> 00:59:19.195
and as someone who's really seen the same breakthroughs in

1379
00:59:19.195 --> 00:59:21.405
our hundreds and hundreds of clients, I can tell you

1380
00:59:21.405 --> 00:59:24.525
that it is a hundred percent possible in your life.

1381
00:59:25.505 --> 00:59:28.125
Here's the thing though, everything that we've covered here

1382
00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.645
is just the tip of the healing iceberg.

1383
00:59:31.085 --> 00:59:32.365
I mean, there's a lot more

1384
00:59:32.365 --> 00:59:34.885
to healing trauma than I could ever possibly cover in a

1385
00:59:34.885 --> 00:59:36.005
short intro training, right?

1386
00:59:36.705 --> 00:59:38.845
So to make all of this work

1387
00:59:38.905 --> 00:59:41.885
for your particular subtle body system in your life,

1388
00:59:42.265 --> 00:59:43.685
here's some things you still need to know.

1389
00:59:43.905 --> 00:59:46.205
You need to know how to adjust your energetic center

1390
00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:47.805
of gravity into the body

1391
00:59:47.825 --> 00:59:49.965
and out of the mind so that you're starting

1392
00:59:49.985 --> 00:59:51.845
to heal from a more embodied place.

1393
00:59:52.185 --> 00:59:54.405
You need to know which parts of your body mind system are

1394
00:59:54.405 --> 00:59:56.525
engaged and which parts have been disconnected

1395
00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:58.125
so you don't waste time fixing things

1396
00:59:58.405 --> 00:59:59.525
that aren't actually having trouble.

1397
01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:01.845
You need to know the proper order

1398
01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.565
and function to apply these new skills so

1399
01:00:04.565 --> 01:00:05.805
that you don't make things worse

1400
01:00:06.345 --> 01:00:09.405
or unexpectedly Send your protector system into a spiral.

1401
01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:12.285
You need to know how to tell whether

1402
01:00:12.545 --> 01:00:15.245
or not you're jumping out of your body energetically what

1403
01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.485
to do immediately to come back

1404
01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:18.405
and to be more grounded in a way

1405
01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:19.925
that prevents panic and anxiety.

1406
01:00:20.665 --> 01:00:23.325
And when your protector system does get a little triggered,

1407
01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:25.885
you need to know the exact steps to calm

1408
01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:28.885
and rewire that so that you're truly healing your system

1409
01:00:28.905 --> 01:00:30.205
and preventing issues in the future.

1410
01:00:31.305 --> 01:00:34.605
You need to gently rehab your subtle body's ability

1411
01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:37.085
to let the helpful, nourishing things in

1412
01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:38.845
and to keep the crappy

1413
01:00:39.065 --> 01:00:41.605
but familiar old patterns out so

1414
01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.285
that you stop repeating those old

1415
01:00:43.285 --> 01:00:44.405
patterns and break the cycle.

1416
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:48.635
You also need to understand how the family geometry

1417
01:00:48.735 --> 01:00:50.875
of your family lineage affects your subtle body

1418
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.395
and what to do to literally stop carrying around baggage

1419
01:00:53.395 --> 01:00:54.395
that's not yours.

1420
01:00:55.215 --> 01:00:58.395
And yes, it's true that it has taken me multiple medical

1421
01:00:58.865 --> 01:01:02.795
degrees and years to perf to sort of perfect this system

1422
01:01:02.795 --> 01:01:05.075
that I use to get our clients reliable results,

1423
01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:07.755
even when all the other healing methods they've tried have

1424
01:01:07.895 --> 01:01:09.275
gotten not gotten them there.

1425
01:01:09.935 --> 01:01:10.995
It is not something

1426
01:01:10.995 --> 01:01:13.115
that anyone can just figure out on their own,

1427
01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.075
and that's why I created the su, the Body Wisdom Academy,

1428
01:01:16.135 --> 01:01:18.715
subtle Body and Trauma Releasing System.

1429
01:01:19.105 --> 01:01:21.875
This is the system that incorporates everything we've talked

1430
01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:23.195
about today and more.

1431
01:01:23.985 --> 01:01:27.115
This is the system that will lift you out of the baggage

1432
01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:30.115
that you have been carrying, clear out the hidden sources

1433
01:01:30.215 --> 01:01:31.555
of stress and sadness

1434
01:01:32.135 --> 01:01:35.515
and really power up your true soul confidence aligning you

1435
01:01:35.515 --> 01:01:38.675
with your purpose automatically as the trauma gets released.

1436
01:01:39.745 --> 01:01:42.965
The Body Wisdom Academy is a complete trauma healing system

1437
01:01:43.355 --> 01:01:45.285
that creates genuine inner peace

1438
01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:48.005
and freedom from the past that allows you to live life

1439
01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:51.985
as you truly are, reconnect your subtle body wiring in a

1440
01:01:51.985 --> 01:01:54.825
comprehensive way and watch all of the areas

1441
01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:55.945
of your life improve.

1442
01:01:56.655 --> 01:01:59.625
It's powered by ancient understanding of how the mind, body,

1443
01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:02.945
spirit system works on a technical level along with how

1444
01:02:02.945 --> 01:02:04.625
to actually integrate that healing into all

1445
01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:05.865
aspects of your modern life.

1446
01:02:06.645 --> 01:02:10.015
This is the exact system I've used to create my ideal life

1447
01:02:10.195 --> 01:02:11.735
and that I've taught to my patients

1448
01:02:11.735 --> 01:02:13.415
and my clients over the past 10 years.

1449
01:02:14.235 --> 01:02:16.135
And actually it's even better.

1450
01:02:16.205 --> 01:02:19.175
It's the exact system plus the refinements and improvements

1451
01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:21.005
and enhancements we've developed

1452
01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.685
to make it even more and more effective.

1453
01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:24.525
It's called the Body Wisdom Academy

1454
01:02:24.525 --> 01:02:27.045
because it's learning that you get to keep

1455
01:02:27.065 --> 01:02:28.165
for the rest of your life.

1456
01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:32.125
So you always know what to do to be centered, aligned,

1457
01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:34.165
and on purpose, free from the

1458
01:02:34.165 --> 01:02:35.405
trauma and patterns of the past.

1459
01:02:36.855 --> 01:02:39.275
All you have to do is follow the step-by-step process

1460
01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:42.915
as we help you apply the tools to your precise situation

1461
01:02:43.935 --> 01:02:45.235
and then everybody is different.

1462
01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:47.755
So one size fits all approach doesn't really work

1463
01:02:47.815 --> 01:02:49.955
for this advanced level of deeper healing.

1464
01:02:50.945 --> 01:02:53.235
Unfortunately, the industry standard

1465
01:02:53.235 --> 01:02:57.635
for coaching programs often ends up looking like dumping you

1466
01:02:57.635 --> 01:03:00.155
with some content and if you have questions

1467
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:03.035
or need support, you end up on a gigantic group call

1468
01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:04.555
where you're one out of a hundred people

1469
01:03:04.895 --> 01:03:05.915
or you're making posts

1470
01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.315
to some huge Facebook group hoping someone will answer.

1471
01:03:09.255 --> 01:03:12.235
It really kind of drives me crazy when coaches tout get

1472
01:03:12.235 --> 01:03:15.115
access to Are You, you know, our exclusive Facebook group

1473
01:03:15.695 --> 01:03:18.035
as if that's some huge source of support.

1474
01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:20.235
Now Facebook groups can be helpful

1475
01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:22.515
and we use them ourselves to give people info

1476
01:03:22.515 --> 01:03:23.635
and to create community,

1477
01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:26.515
but when it comes to actually deep healing work,

1478
01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:28.635
you need actual individualized support

1479
01:03:28.665 --> 01:03:30.275
with another human being there with you.

1480
01:03:31.255 --> 01:03:34.355
And a lot of these big group coaching programs are designed

1481
01:03:34.415 --> 01:03:35.835
by online marketers

1482
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:39.395
and business coaches, not by clinicians like me who are used

1483
01:03:39.395 --> 01:03:41.355
to getting people life-changing results.

1484
01:03:42.225 --> 01:03:44.115
What we do is different.

1485
01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:48.675
We do a walk beside you approach each step of the way,

1486
01:03:48.805 --> 01:03:50.635
which I've seen is what's required.

1487
01:03:50.635 --> 01:03:52.755
When you really get down to this deeper level

1488
01:03:52.755 --> 01:03:55.755
of subtle body work, you need the proven system

1489
01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:59.035
and the expert guidance to apply that to your life

1490
01:03:59.095 --> 01:04:02.995
and your subtle body so you know that whatever comes up,

1491
01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.555
we've got you and you'll get to the other side.

1492
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:10.155
So in the Body Wisdom Academy, along with our proven system

1493
01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:12.715
of subtle body and trauma release work training,

1494
01:04:13.215 --> 01:04:16.235
you get weekly access to what we call healing calls.

1495
01:04:16.605 --> 01:04:20.115
These are sacred space three to four person sessions

1496
01:04:20.385 --> 01:04:22.315
with guaranteed personal attention

1497
01:04:22.385 --> 01:04:25.035
with my core coaches who've I've personally trained

1498
01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:26.115
and worked with for years.

1499
01:04:26.745 --> 01:04:29.275
When it's your turn, it's just you and the coach together.

1500
01:04:29.535 --> 01:04:32.635
Nobody else is there commenting on your things.

1501
01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.435
There's other people waiting for their turn

1502
01:04:34.455 --> 01:04:37.355
and you get to hear what other people might be going through

1503
01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.715
so that you know you're not the only one that is going

1504
01:04:39.715 --> 01:04:41.675
through these things and you work

1505
01:04:42.025 --> 01:04:44.035
with a coach on whatever is coming up for you.

1506
01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:46.675
And this isn't like therapy where you have

1507
01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:49.435
to rehash all the stories of the crap that happened

1508
01:04:49.435 --> 01:04:50.795
to you in the past, which often

1509
01:04:50.795 --> 01:04:51.875
just leaves you feeling worse.

1510
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.795
Instead, we are helping you decode

1511
01:04:54.795 --> 01:04:57.155
what your body is bringing up as the priority

1512
01:04:57.535 --> 01:05:00.035
and helping you apply the subtle body tools so

1513
01:05:00.035 --> 01:05:01.955
that you walk away feeling actually lighter

1514
01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:03.315
and more healed after each session.

1515
01:05:04.615 --> 01:05:06.715
You also get access to me, Leslie,

1516
01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:08.875
directly in my regular teaching calls

1517
01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.235
where I can help you answer any questions that are coming up

1518
01:05:11.815 --> 01:05:13.115
and there's even an option

1519
01:05:13.115 --> 01:05:16.515
to add on additional healing call time with me personally if

1520
01:05:16.515 --> 01:05:18.140
that's something that something that you'd like to add in.

1521
01:05:18.905 --> 01:05:22.485
So because we are here walking beside you each step

1522
01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.845
of the way, you don't have to worry about getting lost

1523
01:05:24.905 --> 01:05:27.245
or overwhelmed because we are always

1524
01:05:27.245 --> 01:05:28.485
there if something comes up.

1525
01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:31.445
Now here's what the Body Wisdom Academy includes.

1526
01:05:31.815 --> 01:05:36.525
There are over 14 info packed multi-video modules

1527
01:05:36.525 --> 01:05:37.965
with checklists and practices,

1528
01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:39.885
but I know that nobody really cares about

1529
01:05:39.885 --> 01:05:40.925
the number of modules.

1530
01:05:41.345 --> 01:05:44.885
So right from the start, you get live

1531
01:05:44.985 --> 01:05:47.525
and personalized Zoom calls to get you oriented

1532
01:05:47.745 --> 01:05:49.205
to start tracking your progress

1533
01:05:49.465 --> 01:05:51.565
and to get you on the fast track to success.

1534
01:05:52.275 --> 01:05:53.685
Here is the crux of what you're going

1535
01:05:54.045 --> 01:05:56.165
to get in the Body Wisdom Academy training.

1536
01:05:57.025 --> 01:05:59.525
You're going to unlock your body's code.

1537
01:05:59.745 --> 01:06:02.605
We start by engaging all levels of your subtle body

1538
01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.685
so you start feeling calmer

1539
01:06:04.685 --> 01:06:06.165
and more centered from the get go.

1540
01:06:06.825 --> 01:06:08.845
You learn what we call the basic procedure

1541
01:06:08.905 --> 01:06:10.205
to get you in your body

1542
01:06:10.225 --> 01:06:12.205
and to start reconnecting any parts

1543
01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:13.685
that may have gotten sidelined

1544
01:06:13.685 --> 01:06:14.845
or disconnected along the way.

1545
01:06:15.115 --> 01:06:17.685
This is super helpful if you tend to be in your head

1546
01:06:18.065 --> 01:06:20.365
or even if you feel like you're pretty good friends

1547
01:06:20.365 --> 01:06:22.445
with your body, you'll start to get deeper results

1548
01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:25.005
and feeling calm and centered for longer periods of time.

1549
01:06:26.345 --> 01:06:27.915
Next, we focus on resistance.

1550
01:06:28.255 --> 01:06:30.395
As we start, we connecting all the levels

1551
01:06:30.415 --> 01:06:33.515
of your subtle body, your protector system is going

1552
01:06:33.515 --> 01:06:34.515
to notice that we're headed

1553
01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:36.675
for new deeper healing territory.

1554
01:06:36.895 --> 01:06:39.915
So right from the beginning we are giving you the new tools

1555
01:06:39.935 --> 01:06:42.955
to be able to catch sneaky resistance and to calm

1556
01:06:42.975 --> 01:06:46.195
and heal your protector system activation so it uplevels

1557
01:06:46.455 --> 01:06:50.155
to allow you to allow in the deeper work that you're doing.

1558
01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:54.705
Next phase is we do reconnection.

1559
01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:58.265
Now you're ready to start healing core wounds

1560
01:06:58.265 --> 01:06:59.585
that have been trapped in your system.

1561
01:06:59.585 --> 01:07:02.665
Sometimes for years you'll notice that the shifts

1562
01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:04.945
and results you're feeling start to speed up here

1563
01:07:04.945 --> 01:07:06.265
as we implement the tools together.

1564
01:07:06.725 --> 01:07:09.505
And this is also where we reconnect deeper aspects

1565
01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.425
of the subtle body like the heart protector

1566
01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:12.905
and the back of the heart, which we haven't

1567
01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:13.945
even had time to talk about.

1568
01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:16.825
And to make sure that the central energetic access

1569
01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:17.945
of your body from the heart

1570
01:07:17.945 --> 01:07:20.105
to pelvis is running smoothly as it should be.

1571
01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:22.785
You'll also get tools to start being able

1572
01:07:22.785 --> 01:07:24.625
to really trust your body intuition,

1573
01:07:24.995 --> 01:07:27.745
which is different just than the intuition from your mind.

1574
01:07:28.205 --> 01:07:31.305
So you can let go of this any lingering self-doubt

1575
01:07:31.685 --> 01:07:33.705
and then we move into the phase of expansion.

1576
01:07:33.815 --> 01:07:35.505
This is where we continue

1577
01:07:35.505 --> 01:07:37.865
to expand your healing results into more

1578
01:07:37.865 --> 01:07:39.505
and more aspects of your outer life.

1579
01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:43.825
We dive deep into what energetic boundaries actually are

1580
01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:47.385
and how to easily maintain them with family and coworkers.

1581
01:07:47.805 --> 01:07:51.305
We give you the exact formula to energetically communicate

1582
01:07:51.305 --> 01:07:52.905
with your spouse or partner in a way

1583
01:07:52.905 --> 01:07:55.545
that magically inspires them to show up

1584
01:07:55.545 --> 01:07:56.985
for you in the way that you've been craving.

1585
01:07:57.685 --> 01:07:59.985
You'll also learn how to attract the types

1586
01:07:59.985 --> 01:08:01.905
of romantic relationships you've been wanting

1587
01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:05.385
by understanding different energetic archetypes.

1588
01:08:06.495 --> 01:08:10.625
This expansion stage really finally kind of helps you

1589
01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:14.745
alter your own subtle body antennae I'll sometimes say so

1590
01:08:14.745 --> 01:08:17.565
that you start to naturally repel narcissists

1591
01:08:17.585 --> 01:08:19.925
and chi vampires instead of attracting people

1592
01:08:19.925 --> 01:08:23.365
who just wanna take advantage of you will also give you

1593
01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.885
what you need to heal your family geometry

1594
01:08:25.945 --> 01:08:28.525
and make sure that you're no longer the family baggage

1595
01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:30.565
holder of carrying stuff that isn't even yours.

1596
01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:34.795
Now I'm not going to sugarcoat this.

1597
01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:38.795
It does take courage and some effort to do real healing work

1598
01:08:39.135 --> 01:08:42.595
and you as you would, you know, probably expect,

1599
01:08:42.775 --> 01:08:46.515
but at the same time I've learned how to make it as easy

1600
01:08:46.615 --> 01:08:50.155
for you as possible no matter what your learning style

1601
01:08:50.255 --> 01:08:51.635
or your life situation.

1602
01:08:51.945 --> 01:08:54.675
This course is built for busy women in mind, which is

1603
01:08:54.675 --> 01:08:55.835
who most of our clients are.

1604
01:08:55.935 --> 01:09:00.035
We work mostly with women ages 35 to 55 and we've had women

1605
01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:03.315
and some men who really get it and can do the deeper work.

1606
01:09:03.735 --> 01:09:05.475
Uh, some people have been in their twenties

1607
01:09:05.535 --> 01:09:07.635
and we've Hal also had people in their seventies complete

1608
01:09:07.635 --> 01:09:08.675
the program successfully.

1609
01:09:09.615 --> 01:09:13.435
We have streamlined this healing process down to a science

1610
01:09:13.735 --> 01:09:16.595
and I will equip you with a clear checkpoint

1611
01:09:16.595 --> 01:09:17.715
that we call gateways.

1612
01:09:17.855 --> 01:09:20.595
So you always know what skills you should be focusing on

1613
01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:24.275
when, and we are there for you every week on healing calls,

1614
01:09:24.275 --> 01:09:26.155
helping you implement at each step

1615
01:09:26.155 --> 01:09:27.555
of the way across time zones

1616
01:09:27.575 --> 01:09:29.315
and what works for your schedule.

1617
01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:31.235
It's really just a matter

1618
01:09:31.235 --> 01:09:32.875
of following the step-by-step process.

1619
01:09:33.305 --> 01:09:36.435
This becomes the building blocks that reconnect

1620
01:09:36.535 --> 01:09:38.555
how your subtle body system should be running

1621
01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:41.355
and paves the way for actually getting to places

1622
01:09:41.615 --> 01:09:43.595
so good you didn't even think that they were possible.

1623
01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:47.195
Technically, the value of this program for me

1624
01:09:47.215 --> 01:09:48.915
and for the hundreds of people I've worked

1625
01:09:48.915 --> 01:09:51.395
with has been absolutely priceless.

1626
01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:54.315
How can you possibly quantify healing your deepest wounds

1627
01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:56.675
and living the life that you've only dreamed about before?

1628
01:09:57.455 --> 01:10:00.155
My clients have also increased their incomes,

1629
01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:02.075
left unfulfilling relationships

1630
01:10:02.135 --> 01:10:04.955
and jobs that they hated attracted their soulmate partners

1631
01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:07.235
and friends bought their dream home.

1632
01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:10.955
I'm not kidding you, those are some pretty invaluable

1633
01:10:10.955 --> 01:10:14.355
breakthroughs and I want you to really hear me when I say

1634
01:10:14.785 --> 01:10:18.395
that You will experience actual outer world shifts in a

1635
01:10:18.675 --> 01:10:21.395
fraction of the time that therapy, somatic work, breath work

1636
01:10:21.415 --> 01:10:23.275
and other healing modalities bring about.

1637
01:10:24.735 --> 01:10:26.905
Take our client Susan for example.

1638
01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:28.265
This was a a win

1639
01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:29.945
and a share that I wanna share with you here.

1640
01:10:31.515 --> 01:10:34.105
Since she completed her time in the Body Wisdom Academy,

1641
01:10:34.525 --> 01:10:37.025
she has doubled her income and is still growing.

1642
01:10:37.765 --> 01:10:40.105
So I know the point of this training is not money.

1643
01:10:40.225 --> 01:10:43.265
I wanna be clear and I just wanna show you the power

1644
01:10:43.285 --> 01:10:44.465
of healing your trauma.

1645
01:10:44.495 --> 01:10:47.265
Sometimes we don't even realize it because we're in it.

1646
01:10:47.635 --> 01:10:48.785
Susan didn't even realize

1647
01:10:48.885 --> 01:10:50.465
how much her blind spots had been

1648
01:10:50.465 --> 01:10:51.705
holding her back in her career.

1649
01:10:52.205 --> 01:10:54.905
So that's just one example of quantifiable shifts

1650
01:10:54.905 --> 01:10:56.305
that you can experience in this program.

1651
01:10:56.655 --> 01:10:59.025
With that said, you know, what's the value

1652
01:10:59.045 --> 01:11:00.145
of the Body Wisdom Academy?

1653
01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:06.105
Well, the training material itself teaches you everything

1654
01:11:06.685 --> 01:11:08.625
you need to know to deal with your trauma,

1655
01:11:08.995 --> 01:11:11.585
clear your blocks past, present, and future

1656
01:11:12.085 --> 01:11:14.605
and stand on your own two feet as your own healer.

1657
01:11:15.185 --> 01:11:16.725
So let's look at the value

1658
01:11:16.745 --> 01:11:18.845
of the program in a logical, practical way.

1659
01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:21.805
If you saw a good therapist weekly for a year,

1660
01:11:22.185 --> 01:11:25.765
that's over $6,000 a year easily might fluctuate a little

1661
01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:26.845
depending on where you live in the country.

1662
01:11:27.465 --> 01:11:30.765
So knowing that most people do several years

1663
01:11:30.765 --> 01:11:33.365
of therapy plus maybe something like a yoga teacher training

1664
01:11:33.365 --> 01:11:34.885
or a health coaching, you name it,

1665
01:11:35.565 --> 01:11:37.045
multiple modalities and workshops.

1666
01:11:37.055 --> 01:11:39.405
We're talking about at least 30 K or more,

1667
01:11:39.825 --> 01:11:41.805
but let's just put that number on there.

1668
01:11:42.425 --> 01:11:44.485
We consistently see people

1669
01:11:45.265 --> 01:11:48.445
use their Body Wisdom Academy training to get better results

1670
01:11:49.025 --> 01:11:52.445
and more value than they did in those five to 10 years

1671
01:11:52.445 --> 01:11:53.885
of doing all these other things.

1672
01:11:54.345 --> 01:11:56.965
So we can easily say that the Body Wisdom Academy,

1673
01:11:57.065 --> 01:11:59.725
subtle Body Healing trauma release system is valued

1674
01:11:59.745 --> 01:12:00.805
at $30,000.

1675
01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:02.965
And did I mention

1676
01:12:02.965 --> 01:12:06.405
that the Body Wisdom Academy is a a foundational

1677
01:12:06.885 --> 01:12:08.445
certification level training.

1678
01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:10.925
So when you complete the program,

1679
01:12:11.345 --> 01:12:14.325
not only will you have the benefit yourself in your own

1680
01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:17.645
life, but if you are already doing healing work

1681
01:12:17.645 --> 01:12:19.885
with clients in some capacity as a therapist

1682
01:12:19.885 --> 01:12:22.685
or as a coach, you can use this Body Wisdom Academy

1683
01:12:23.045 --> 01:12:25.285
certification to start incorporating these subtle body

1684
01:12:25.285 --> 01:12:27.605
methods into your own uh, work

1685
01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:29.445
and your work with clients right away.

1686
01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.845
And if you don't have a wellness training background

1687
01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:36.005
or if you're interested in making this your true calling

1688
01:12:36.005 --> 01:12:39.365
career path, we do have a further coach level certification

1689
01:12:39.705 --> 01:12:42.805
beyond the Body Wisdom Academy as well where you can take it

1690
01:12:42.805 --> 01:12:44.005
to the next professional level.

1691
01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:47.605
But either way, the Body Wisdom Academy is the required

1692
01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:49.845
certification training for anything that comes after.

1693
01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:53.325
So not only are you investing in your own healing,

1694
01:12:53.385 --> 01:12:54.805
you're laying the groundwork

1695
01:12:54.905 --> 01:12:57.725
for your own healing work in the world with a method

1696
01:12:57.725 --> 01:13:00.445
that allows you to truly serve others in their healing.

1697
01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:02.685
And as we've talked about

1698
01:13:02.685 --> 01:13:06.085
before, you are not meant to do deeper healing work alone.

1699
01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:09.405
This is a program and a system unlike anything you've

1700
01:13:09.405 --> 01:13:11.805
encountered before and your subtle body system

1701
01:13:11.825 --> 01:13:13.605
and life situation are unique to you

1702
01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.405
and you are going to need support

1703
01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:17.605
and have questions along the way.

1704
01:13:17.705 --> 01:13:18.805
I'd be concerned if you didn't.

1705
01:13:19.275 --> 01:13:21.725
This isn't just some school book that you read

1706
01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:23.205
but never do anything with.

1707
01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:25.245
This is a life-changing practice

1708
01:13:25.555 --> 01:13:27.005
that you will be implementing.

1709
01:13:27.305 --> 01:13:28.885
So an integral part

1710
01:13:28.885 --> 01:13:31.125
of the training is getting support on healing calls

1711
01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:34.045
where you practice putting the tools into practice feeling

1712
01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:37.085
the difference, and it means showing up to my teaching calls

1713
01:13:37.085 --> 01:13:39.125
and getting your questions answered by me directly.

1714
01:13:39.595 --> 01:13:41.285
This is what we call live support

1715
01:13:41.745 --> 01:13:44.485
and the Body Wisdom Academy includes 12 weeks

1716
01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:47.045
of all the live support we have to offer a variety

1717
01:13:47.105 --> 01:13:49.445
of healing calls that happen weekly across the North

1718
01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:53.005
American time zones, your individual progress check-in calls

1719
01:13:53.025 --> 01:13:55.285
to help you stay on track and teaching calls with me.

1720
01:13:55.775 --> 01:13:58.525
There is no other program out there

1721
01:13:58.525 --> 01:14:00.405
that supports you in this many ways.

1722
01:14:00.745 --> 01:14:03.885
No huge group calls, no posting in a Facebook group

1723
01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:04.965
to try and get support.

1724
01:14:05.385 --> 01:14:07.405
You get direct and personal inbox

1725
01:14:07.405 --> 01:14:08.605
support whenever you need it.

1726
01:14:08.665 --> 01:14:10.805
On top of the already extensive healing call

1727
01:14:10.805 --> 01:14:12.020
support and checking calls.

1728
01:14:12.745 --> 01:14:15.805
You also get access to all of the material for entire year.

1729
01:14:16.225 --> 01:14:19.445
So it's there as you continue to grow and implement.

1730
01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:22.685
Okay, so let's add these on the Body Wisdom Academy.

1731
01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:26.165
Subtle Body Healing trauma release system value is $30,000

1732
01:14:26.705 --> 01:14:27.765
and the lives support

1733
01:14:27.765 --> 01:14:30.005
and mentorship you get along with the system,

1734
01:14:30.005 --> 01:14:33.285
which includes weekly healing calls with multiple options

1735
01:14:33.345 --> 01:14:35.165
to choose the ones that work for you.

1736
01:14:35.515 --> 01:14:38.045
Your private onboarding call, checking calls

1737
01:14:38.105 --> 01:14:39.485
and teaching calls with me along

1738
01:14:39.485 --> 01:14:42.125
with inbox support over your 12 weeks has a value

1739
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:43.525
of over $15,000.

1740
01:14:44.035 --> 01:14:46.885
This individualized attention is where the magic is at

1741
01:14:46.885 --> 01:14:48.965
and ensures that we can get you the

1742
01:14:48.965 --> 01:14:50.005
results that you're looking for.

1743
01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:51.485
So let's put it all together.

1744
01:14:51.985 --> 01:14:55.005
So the Body Wisdom Academy system is valued at 30,000.

1745
01:14:55.185 --> 01:14:57.805
The 12 weeks of all the live support from weekly healing

1746
01:14:57.805 --> 01:14:59.725
calls along with your milestone check-ins

1747
01:14:59.725 --> 01:15:02.205
and onboarding as well as teaching calls with me are valued,

1748
01:15:02.305 --> 01:15:03.565
valued at 15,000.

1749
01:15:04.145 --> 01:15:06.965
The ability to get our certification at the completion

1750
01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:08.925
of your program so that you can use it as part

1751
01:15:08.925 --> 01:15:10.605
of your own work with your clients in the future,

1752
01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:12.485
that's another $5,000 of value.

1753
01:15:13.265 --> 01:15:15.685
You also get the value of being a part of a community

1754
01:15:15.685 --> 01:15:16.685
of like-hearted women

1755
01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:19.205
and men who get it from different walks of life,

1756
01:15:19.345 --> 01:15:22.445
but who are all coming together with courage, vulnerability

1757
01:15:22.465 --> 01:15:24.245
to really heal and be their true selves.

1758
01:15:24.675 --> 01:15:26.845
It's a very safe and accepting community

1759
01:15:26.905 --> 01:15:29.085
and we have people who make lifelong friendships

1760
01:15:29.235 --> 01:15:30.805
that they continue to keep in touch with.

1761
01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:34.605
We often hear clients say that there's no one in my town

1762
01:15:34.605 --> 01:15:35.845
that I can talk to about this

1763
01:15:35.945 --> 01:15:37.805
or my family kind of thinks I'm weird.

1764
01:15:37.945 --> 01:15:40.685
So finally finding your sort of hashtag spirit squad

1765
01:15:40.705 --> 01:15:42.005
of like-hearted, sensitive,

1766
01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:45.405
empathic folks interested in healing is beyond something

1767
01:15:45.405 --> 01:15:46.565
that I can put a price tag on.

1768
01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:48.445
So I'm just gonna say priceless with that one.

1769
01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:51.045
Also, when you join the Body Wisdom Academy,

1770
01:15:51.065 --> 01:15:53.765
you'll get access to exclusive invites

1771
01:15:53.765 --> 01:15:55.565
to our live in person workshops

1772
01:15:55.715 --> 01:15:57.285
that happen several times per year.

1773
01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:59.845
Now these are life-changing weekends where we get

1774
01:15:59.845 --> 01:16:02.165
to be in person together in a super

1775
01:16:02.165 --> 01:16:03.805
transformative healing environment.

1776
01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:06.845
And I promise it's unlike any other workshop you've ever

1777
01:16:06.845 --> 01:16:09.245
been to these in-person intensives.

1778
01:16:09.245 --> 01:16:10.805
They're not open to the public

1779
01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:12.405
and they're only available to people

1780
01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:13.885
who have already previously gone

1781
01:16:13.885 --> 01:16:15.125
through our Body Wisdom Academy.

1782
01:16:15.495 --> 01:16:17.565
Again, some of my biggest healing breakthroughs have

1783
01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:20.125
happened on retreats, so it's hard to put the value here

1784
01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:21.925
and I'm gonna label that as priceless.

1785
01:16:21.925 --> 01:16:24.565
If you should choose to come to one of those, what

1786
01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:26.885
that means for you is that the total value of

1787
01:16:26.885 --> 01:16:29.325
what you're getting is over $50,000.

1788
01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:31.805
So let me just turn it around

1789
01:16:31.805 --> 01:16:33.285
for a second and ask you a question.

1790
01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:36.405
If you were actually free from the trapped trauma

1791
01:16:36.405 --> 01:16:38.365
of the past and living your life purpose,

1792
01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:42.205
feeling consistently confident, peaceful, no matter

1793
01:16:42.235 --> 01:16:44.965
what came up in your life, what would that be worth to you

1794
01:16:45.785 --> 01:16:47.725
if your relationship felt easy

1795
01:16:47.785 --> 01:16:50.325
and deeply fulfilling if your career were in alignment

1796
01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:51.525
with your heart's desires,

1797
01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:55.005
if you were easily keeping your cool without taking on other

1798
01:16:55.005 --> 01:16:59.205
people's energy or drama, if you woke up with a clear sense

1799
01:16:59.205 --> 01:17:00.285
of knowing who you are

1800
01:17:00.345 --> 01:17:03.285
and why you're here feeling spiritually grounded

1801
01:17:03.305 --> 01:17:07.285
and on purpose, would it be worth investing $50,000 just

1802
01:17:07.285 --> 01:17:10.150
once to keep getting that outcome for the rest of your life?

1803
01:17:10.915 --> 01:17:13.965
What about having that benefit go forward into your family

1804
01:17:14.105 --> 01:17:15.205
and children's lives

1805
01:17:15.205 --> 01:17:19.205
because they have stopped suffering from the generational

1806
01:17:19.285 --> 01:17:21.365
patterns that you have ended within yourself?

1807
01:17:22.085 --> 01:17:23.645
I can tell you that if you're not there yet,

1808
01:17:23.645 --> 01:17:26.245
there will come a time in your commitment

1809
01:17:26.245 --> 01:17:27.685
to your inner interpersonal

1810
01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:30.685
and spiritual path where making a 50 K investment

1811
01:17:30.715 --> 01:17:32.965
that you know is so aligned will not

1812
01:17:32.965 --> 01:17:34.085
be that big of a deal at all.

1813
01:17:34.585 --> 01:17:37.245
But today does not have to be that day Instead

1814
01:17:37.245 --> 01:17:40.125
of paying $50,000, the full cost

1815
01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:42.045
of the program is just 4,000.

1816
01:17:42.265 --> 01:17:43.925
That's the standard enrollment price.

1817
01:17:44.665 --> 01:17:47.565
But because I don't believe

1818
01:17:47.565 --> 01:17:49.445
that there are any mistakes in my world,

1819
01:17:49.505 --> 01:17:52.205
and you have really answered the call to be on this training

1820
01:17:52.205 --> 01:17:53.845
with me, you've made it this far

1821
01:17:54.185 --> 01:17:56.285
and you're clearly serious about your healing,

1822
01:17:56.285 --> 01:17:57.885
your soul gifts and your life.

1823
01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:00.885
I wanna make this even more of a no-brainer for you

1824
01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.925
to get started because I know what it's like

1825
01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:05.525
to be suffering in this way

1826
01:18:05.745 --> 01:18:07.445
and I know that what we do works.

1827
01:18:08.345 --> 01:18:11.645
So if you know that this is for you and you take action

1828
01:18:11.745 --> 01:18:12.765
and trust your gut

1829
01:18:12.785 --> 01:18:15.045
and move forward right now, I'm going

1830
01:18:15.045 --> 01:18:17.565
to give you a very special, very limited offer

1831
01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:18.805
because it's not for everyone.

1832
01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.005
Instead of the standard enrollment price of 4,000,

1833
01:18:22.545 --> 01:18:26.085
you can get started today for only 1060.

1834
01:18:26.865 --> 01:18:29.125
You can also do to, you can choose

1835
01:18:29.145 --> 01:18:32.165
to do a pay in full tuition of 3000

1836
01:18:32.705 --> 01:18:34.965
or choose the three month payment plan

1837
01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:37.645
and get started for just $1,060 today.

1838
01:18:38.025 --> 01:18:40.045
So that's a savings of as much

1839
01:18:40.045 --> 01:18:42.685
as a thousand dollars off of the normal price.

1840
01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:44.245
My team thought I was a little bit crazy

1841
01:18:45.065 --> 01:18:47.725
and please know, once this offer is gone,

1842
01:18:47.905 --> 01:18:50.605
it will not come back like as in never, ever, ever.

1843
01:18:50.915 --> 01:18:53.485
This is not some like smoke and mirrors gimmick.

1844
01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:56.085
It's a heartfelt business offering.

1845
01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:57.405
It's an offering that we do

1846
01:18:57.405 --> 01:19:00.685
to really help soul aligned people get started

1847
01:19:00.825 --> 01:19:01.965
and we are committed to that.

1848
01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.085
So there's a little clock there.

1849
01:19:04.145 --> 01:19:06.725
You will have the opportunity to join us in the future

1850
01:19:07.425 --> 01:19:09.605
for the regular enrollment price, absolutely

1851
01:19:10.305 --> 01:19:13.405
for the regular employ regular enrollment price of $4,000.

1852
01:19:13.505 --> 01:19:16.205
But why pay a thousand dollars more just

1853
01:19:16.205 --> 01:19:18.445
to give your protector system time to act up

1854
01:19:18.465 --> 01:19:20.125
for a few days while you're thinking about it?

1855
01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:25.405
Besides this $3,000 trust your gut one-time offer.

1856
01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:26.725
We do not run sales.

1857
01:19:26.985 --> 01:19:28.485
So you can believe me when I say

1858
01:19:28.485 --> 01:19:29.965
that you'll never see this price again

1859
01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:33.405
after the trust your gut fast action period ends.

1860
01:19:33.705 --> 01:19:36.925
Now let me put this into some perspective here.

1861
01:19:37.365 --> 01:19:40.805
I want you to soar forward into the future.

1862
01:19:40.945 --> 01:19:42.285
You can close your eyes if that helps.

1863
01:19:42.785 --> 01:19:45.485
And it's six months down the line,

1864
01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:48.605
you've successfully completed your Body Wisdom Academy

1865
01:19:48.965 --> 01:19:51.645
training and you literally feel different in your body.

1866
01:19:52.315 --> 01:19:56.325
Imagine waking up feeling free from the burdens

1867
01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:59.965
that you've gotten so used to carrying you feel confident

1868
01:19:59.985 --> 01:20:02.245
and you're easily sharing your gifts in the world.

1869
01:20:02.505 --> 01:20:05.285
You feel connected and grounded inwardly without really

1870
01:20:05.285 --> 01:20:06.365
having to try so much.

1871
01:20:07.195 --> 01:20:09.965
That annoying guy at work says the same stupid s**t he

1872
01:20:09.965 --> 01:20:12.645
always does, but instead of getting you spun out for days,

1873
01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.925
it literally seems kind of funny to you

1874
01:20:14.925 --> 01:20:16.765
and you just go on with your day unaffected.

1875
01:20:17.425 --> 01:20:20.405
The solutions to things seem to come to you more easily

1876
01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:23.685
and it's hard to even imagine why things seem so much

1877
01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:24.725
of a trigger before.

1878
01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:27.765
So imagine knowing how

1879
01:20:27.765 --> 01:20:30.045
to naturally get your needs met in relationship

1880
01:20:30.145 --> 01:20:32.205
and seeing your spouse step up in ways

1881
01:20:32.435 --> 01:20:34.005
that you didn't even thought were possible.

1882
01:20:35.115 --> 01:20:37.215
One of our graduates, Denise, was on the verge

1883
01:20:37.215 --> 01:20:38.255
of literally divorcing her

1884
01:20:38.255 --> 01:20:39.375
husband when she came into the program.

1885
01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:41.255
We talked about it in her onboarding call

1886
01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:44.815
and by the time she graduated, she was astonished

1887
01:20:44.815 --> 01:20:47.615
that their relationship was at this new level of closeness

1888
01:20:47.805 --> 01:20:50.215
that they hadn't had in all of their decades

1889
01:20:50.355 --> 01:20:51.415
of married life together.

1890
01:20:51.715 --> 01:20:54.855
She was pretty shocked. So imagine

1891
01:20:55.615 --> 01:20:58.175
actually attracting your ideal romantic partner, not

1892
01:20:58.175 --> 01:20:59.815
because they need fixing, but

1893
01:20:59.815 --> 01:21:02.175
because they're actually spiritually aligned so

1894
01:21:02.175 --> 01:21:03.935
that you can truly build a better

1895
01:21:03.935 --> 01:21:05.535
relationship than you thought possible.

1896
01:21:05.915 --> 01:21:09.975
And the benefits that you see are seeing aren't just in you.

1897
01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:13.535
You see your family thriving, your children seem calmer,

1898
01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:16.535
calmer and happier, and you know that they won't have to go

1899
01:21:16.535 --> 01:21:18.135
through the painful generational things

1900
01:21:18.135 --> 01:21:19.335
that you've had to endure.

1901
01:21:19.365 --> 01:21:21.855
This is your healing magnified.

1902
01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:25.015
It's a lifetime worth of healing for just $3,000

1903
01:21:25.155 --> 01:21:27.735
or even just 1,060 today.

1904
01:21:28.435 --> 01:21:31.535
So now I have some commonly asked questions that I'm going

1905
01:21:31.535 --> 01:21:32.535
to answer for you, but

1906
01:21:32.535 --> 01:21:34.615
before I do, I have a few things to share

1907
01:21:34.615 --> 01:21:37.495
with you from previous Body Wisdom Academy graduates.

1908
01:21:38.605 --> 01:21:42.295
This is Jordan. She is just a wonderful sensitive soul.

1909
01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:44.655
She actually grew up in the same city that I did

1910
01:21:44.675 --> 01:21:47.255
and she said the system works when I work the system

1911
01:21:47.315 --> 01:21:50.495
and I'm definitely noticing tangible results with it

1912
01:21:50.495 --> 01:21:51.735
that inspire, encourage,

1913
01:21:51.795 --> 01:21:54.935
and motivate me to keep utilizing these tools and practices.

1914
01:21:54.935 --> 01:21:59.175
That's awesome. Jana was a nurse practitioner, she still is,

1915
01:21:59.235 --> 01:22:02.375
and after two weeks in BWA, she sent us this feedback.

1916
01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:03.495
She's like, I'm gonna be honest,

1917
01:22:04.135 --> 01:22:06.895
I never thought in my life it would be that fast of results

1918
01:22:07.035 --> 01:22:10.095
and instantaneous because therapy is not instantaneous.

1919
01:22:10.285 --> 01:22:11.895
It's a lot of talking, talking, talking.

1920
01:22:12.405 --> 01:22:14.775
I've had more aha moments in the last two weeks than

1921
01:22:14.775 --> 01:22:15.935
I've had in a lifetime.

1922
01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:19.415
So thank you Meredith, uh,

1923
01:22:19.475 --> 01:22:21.215
who is a wonderful BW grad

1924
01:22:21.355 --> 01:22:24.055
and still stays in touch say it's changed my relationship

1925
01:22:24.115 --> 01:22:26.015
and that I've stopped depending on outer

1926
01:22:26.015 --> 01:22:27.255
relationships to fulfill me.

1927
01:22:27.255 --> 01:22:30.095
And I'm really taking the leap towards my own fulfillment.

1928
01:22:30.315 --> 01:22:32.375
And because I know and she stays has stayed in touch

1929
01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:35.055
with us, I know that she is actually in a wonderful, uh,

1930
01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:37.455
last couple years relationships that came up for her

1931
01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:38.855
after BWA

1932
01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.695
and really, uh, happily working on that,

1933
01:22:41.575 --> 01:22:42.735
a low quote from Lila.

1934
01:22:42.955 --> 01:22:45.735
She said, I have long been searching

1935
01:22:45.835 --> 01:22:47.135
and reading all the things

1936
01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:50.415
and while I've made a great many things, uh,

1937
01:22:50.415 --> 01:22:52.615
learned a great many things and have made certain levels

1938
01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:55.535
of progress, I've been completely frustrated

1939
01:22:55.555 --> 01:22:56.895
by the just let it go.

1940
01:22:56.915 --> 01:22:59.255
Advice that so many give, it's a phrase that

1941
01:22:59.275 --> 01:23:00.855
so many spiritual leaders throw around,

1942
01:23:01.035 --> 01:23:02.335
let this go, let that go.

1943
01:23:02.835 --> 01:23:05.685
But no one that I've encountered has ever been able

1944
01:23:05.685 --> 01:23:09.325
to provide a definition or method of how exactly to do that.

1945
01:23:10.035 --> 01:23:11.125
Clearly my intention

1946
01:23:11.145 --> 01:23:13.325
to let something go is not enough to do the trick.

1947
01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.045
Finally, with Leslie's teaching

1948
01:23:15.045 --> 01:23:17.845
and methods, there is a way to figure out what it is,

1949
01:23:18.305 --> 01:23:20.085
get down to it and really remove it.

1950
01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:21.725
I am so, so grateful for that.

1951
01:23:23.155 --> 01:23:26.975
And a note from Carly who is now not just a BWA graduate

1952
01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:29.135
but has also gone on to complete the coach training,

1953
01:23:29.595 --> 01:23:31.255
she said I had tried a few different ways

1954
01:23:31.255 --> 01:23:32.335
to help clear the blocks

1955
01:23:32.435 --> 01:23:35.135
but always reverted back to previous patterns and habits.

1956
01:23:35.805 --> 01:23:38.255
This gave me the tools I need to work with myself,

1957
01:23:38.285 --> 01:23:39.695
grow my intuition, and be able

1958
01:23:39.695 --> 01:23:41.575
to communicate directly with myself.

1959
01:23:41.835 --> 01:23:44.855
The blocks that I've gotten rid of have stayed that way.

1960
01:23:45.715 --> 01:23:47.295
So just a few things.

1961
01:23:47.755 --> 01:23:50.135
Really wonderful to see their beautiful faces.

1962
01:23:50.965 --> 01:23:52.695
It's kinda helpful. Okay,

1963
01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:55.095
so now let's dig into some questions.

1964
01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.975
When does it start? Unlike a lot

1965
01:23:58.975 --> 01:24:02.175
of coachy coaches out there, we are not trying to get a herd

1966
01:24:02.175 --> 01:24:03.335
of gazillion customers

1967
01:24:03.335 --> 01:24:05.375
and scale to the moon to have some huge program

1968
01:24:05.745 --> 01:24:06.815
where we just get a ton

1969
01:24:06.815 --> 01:24:08.335
of people in the door and then forget about them.

1970
01:24:08.965 --> 01:24:11.615
This is a soul aligned offering for me

1971
01:24:11.635 --> 01:24:12.815
and we are on a mission.

1972
01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:15.095
We are committed to personalized,

1973
01:24:15.455 --> 01:24:16.615
targeted healing and results.

1974
01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:18.455
What that means practically is

1975
01:24:18.455 --> 01:24:20.655
that we work on a capacity basis

1976
01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.735
because we do individual attention

1977
01:24:23.115 --> 01:24:24.935
and that takes time and human contact.

1978
01:24:25.515 --> 01:24:27.895
So if you're seeing this training, we have space for you now

1979
01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:29.935
because when we're full, the doors close

1980
01:24:29.995 --> 01:24:31.255
and we don't open this training

1981
01:24:31.255 --> 01:24:32.575
to anyone for people to enroll.

1982
01:24:33.755 --> 01:24:36.695
Can I start later? Essentially sort of delayed enrollment?

1983
01:24:36.695 --> 01:24:38.535
Can I delay my start date? Yes.

1984
01:24:38.955 --> 01:24:40.135
If you know you're ready

1985
01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:43.415
and you have some small logistical life thing like a

1986
01:24:43.615 --> 01:24:45.975
vacation, another program is ending, you're moving

1987
01:24:46.475 --> 01:24:48.415
and you need a few extra weeks before you start,

1988
01:24:48.435 --> 01:24:50.015
but you still wanna get that trust,

1989
01:24:50.015 --> 01:24:52.415
your gut fast action rate that I'm offering here.

1990
01:24:52.915 --> 01:24:54.935
You can go through the enrollment process now

1991
01:24:54.935 --> 01:24:55.935
with the button below

1992
01:24:55.955 --> 01:24:58.495
and then reach out to our support team right after that.

1993
01:24:58.705 --> 01:25:00.295
There will be links on how to do that

1994
01:25:00.355 --> 01:25:01.895
and you let them know that you need

1995
01:25:01.895 --> 01:25:03.495
to move your official start date.

1996
01:25:04.565 --> 01:25:06.255
That way you get the benefit

1997
01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.455
of this one time trust your gut bonus,

1998
01:25:08.455 --> 01:25:09.695
which you will not see again

1999
01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:12.575
and you get to start at the time that works for for you.

2000
01:25:14.045 --> 01:25:15.295
What if I'm really busy?

2001
01:25:15.765 --> 01:25:16.935
This is a question we get a lot

2002
01:25:16.935 --> 01:25:20.615
because on average our clients are busy women, busy moms,

2003
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.095
working moms, you've got a lot going on in life.

2004
01:25:23.155 --> 01:25:24.295
So if that's you, good news.

2005
01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:27.815
I have built and refined this program for busy individuals.

2006
01:25:28.035 --> 01:25:30.655
On average, we expect that you will need about three

2007
01:25:30.655 --> 01:25:32.935
to five hours per week to get the most out of this program.

2008
01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:37.575
And because we help you customize the program for your life,

2009
01:25:38.035 --> 01:25:41.655
you'll also get help from us along the way with knowing what

2010
01:25:41.655 --> 01:25:44.815
to focus on, what to prioritize, where you're at,

2011
01:25:45.035 --> 01:25:47.935
and so that you know what you should be focusing on when

2012
01:25:47.995 --> 01:25:49.455
and how to make the most of your time.

2013
01:25:49.995 --> 01:25:52.015
We actually have specific gateways

2014
01:25:52.255 --> 01:25:55.815
and checklists so you know exactly which skills you should

2015
01:25:55.815 --> 01:25:58.695
be developing and know exactly how to track the signs

2016
01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.415
of your subtle body healing process.

2017
01:26:02.165 --> 01:26:05.825
Will this work for mood issues like anxiety, depression,

2018
01:26:06.105 --> 01:26:08.225
procrastination, early childhood trauma complex

2019
01:26:08.385 --> 01:26:10.625
P-T-S-D-A-D-H-D, generational trauma?

2020
01:26:11.245 --> 01:26:12.705
The short answer is yes,

2021
01:26:13.125 --> 01:26:14.745
and it's important for me

2022
01:26:14.745 --> 01:26:16.905
to give here my official medical disclaimer

2023
01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.985
and remind you that the Body Wisdom Academy,

2024
01:26:19.085 --> 01:26:21.185
subtle Body trauma release method is

2025
01:26:21.185 --> 01:26:22.385
not a medical intervention.

2026
01:26:22.495 --> 01:26:25.985
It's not therapy. It is not meant to diagnose, treat, cure,

2027
01:26:26.085 --> 01:26:27.185
or prevent any disease,

2028
01:26:27.185 --> 01:26:28.745
and it's definitely not approved by the Food

2029
01:26:28.745 --> 01:26:30.865
and Drug Administration or your insurance provider.

2030
01:26:31.575 --> 01:26:33.585
That being said, the whole list of things

2031
01:26:33.585 --> 01:26:36.385
that I mentioned like anxiety, depression, different types

2032
01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:39.025
of trauma are all heavily related

2033
01:26:39.165 --> 01:26:40.785
to subtle body dysfunction.

2034
01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:44.225
And we hear every day how these areas of our clients' lives

2035
01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:46.385
and experiences improve drastically

2036
01:26:46.385 --> 01:26:48.585
with subtle body work even when other things have failed.

2037
01:26:49.365 --> 01:26:52.345
And I have been specializing personally in helping people

2038
01:26:52.415 --> 01:26:54.785
heal weird and tricky things that medical specialists,

2039
01:26:54.785 --> 01:26:56.225
other acupuncturists, therapists

2040
01:26:56.225 --> 01:26:58.705
and healers have not been able to help them fix.

2041
01:26:58.885 --> 01:27:00.665
So if that's you, you are in the right place.

2042
01:27:01.975 --> 01:27:04.145
Will this work for making a career change,

2043
01:27:04.145 --> 01:27:06.945
having a better relationship with money, life purpose,

2044
01:27:08.155 --> 01:27:11.375
subtle body news flash here, friends, what we know

2045
01:27:11.395 --> 01:27:13.295
to be true is that your outer world

2046
01:27:13.535 --> 01:27:14.775
reflects your inner world.

2047
01:27:15.035 --> 01:27:17.855
So the things that show up in our outer world are actually

2048
01:27:17.855 --> 01:27:21.295
results of the organizational, of the sum total

2049
01:27:21.355 --> 01:27:22.975
of our mind, body, spirit system.

2050
01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:24.375
They are not separate from us.

2051
01:27:24.915 --> 01:27:26.055
So it is

2052
01:27:26.055 --> 01:27:28.655
therefore true that when we change our inner worlds,

2053
01:27:28.715 --> 01:27:30.535
our outer worlds will shift in a way

2054
01:27:30.535 --> 01:27:33.615
that surprises us again, always better to judge by results.

2055
01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:36.175
Here's a couple of examples of how our clients

2056
01:27:36.725 --> 01:27:39.135
came into the Body Wisdom Academy

2057
01:27:39.275 --> 01:27:40.375
to work on their own healing

2058
01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:43.775
and were pleasantly surprised by how that also overflowed

2059
01:27:43.775 --> 01:27:46.375
and created big shifts in their outer working

2060
01:27:46.435 --> 01:27:47.735
and financial lives as well.

2061
01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:53.925
Meet our BWA graduate Susan, she works in a really, uh,

2062
01:27:53.945 --> 01:27:57.125
an environment at her work where there's a lot of sort

2063
01:27:57.125 --> 01:27:59.165
of inner political personality issues

2064
01:27:59.165 --> 01:28:00.285
that had sometimes felt limiting

2065
01:28:00.305 --> 01:28:01.605
and really challenging in the past.

2066
01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:04.045
And she shared this with us after BWA

2067
01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:06.685
and said, I have almost doubled my salary since the summer

2068
01:28:06.945 --> 01:28:08.725
and I'm applying to co-chair my division.

2069
01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:11.485
I'm building alliances with confidence and compassion

2070
01:28:11.825 --> 01:28:14.325
and with the money I will buy a surprise vacation

2071
01:28:14.335 --> 01:28:15.725
engagement ring for my David.

2072
01:28:15.945 --> 01:28:17.245
I'm grounded in life is good.

2073
01:28:17.265 --> 01:28:20.045
So really having that overflow into our personal partner

2074
01:28:20.105 --> 01:28:21.805
and love life as well, which is great.

2075
01:28:22.515 --> 01:28:24.565
This is Carolyn, who is a wonderful,

2076
01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:27.845
wonderful heartfelt seeker, has done so much work in yoga

2077
01:28:27.945 --> 01:28:30.845
and spirituality and was struggling at her job

2078
01:28:31.065 --> 01:28:33.765
and she actually decided to continue

2079
01:28:33.765 --> 01:28:36.125
and go on to our coach training, uh, partly

2080
01:28:36.125 --> 01:28:38.165
because she landed an amazing job

2081
01:28:38.165 --> 01:28:39.565
that she didn't even think was coming

2082
01:28:39.705 --> 01:28:40.765
and she, one of the things

2083
01:28:40.765 --> 01:28:43.685
that helped her the most from her BWA time that she shared

2084
01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:46.565
with me was really feeling confident to negotiate

2085
01:28:46.565 --> 01:28:49.925
and ask for a higher salary, feeling heartfelt

2086
01:28:50.305 --> 01:28:52.085
and also successful in the world.

2087
01:28:52.195 --> 01:28:54.325
This is a thing that as empaths

2088
01:28:54.325 --> 01:28:57.565
and sensitive seekers we often struggle with of how

2089
01:28:57.585 --> 01:28:58.965
to be compassionate and loving

2090
01:28:59.345 --> 01:29:01.845
and also do things in the world

2091
01:29:02.025 --> 01:29:05.005
and really hold ourselves to a high level

2092
01:29:05.005 --> 01:29:07.885
of worthiness when it comes to things like salary and work.

2093
01:29:07.945 --> 01:29:09.765
So she's really happy at her new position.

2094
01:29:11.355 --> 01:29:14.925
Will this work for physical issues like pain, insomnia,

2095
01:29:15.285 --> 01:29:17.685
migraines, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, menstrual issues?

2096
01:29:18.215 --> 01:29:19.485
Again, official reminder

2097
01:29:19.685 --> 01:29:22.125
and disclaimer that this is not a medical intervention

2098
01:29:22.185 --> 01:29:24.885
and my methods are not designed to diagnose, cure, treat,

2099
01:29:24.885 --> 01:29:26.125
prevent any disease

2100
01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:27.805
and they have not been approved by the FDA.

2101
01:29:28.145 --> 01:29:32.285
And when you are a mind, body, spirit system, everything

2102
01:29:32.285 --> 01:29:34.845
that you experience, your physical pain, your emotions,

2103
01:29:35.185 --> 01:29:37.605
et cetera, we'll have some strong links

2104
01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:38.725
to your subtle body system

2105
01:29:38.725 --> 01:29:41.485
because that is the basis of you being a human being.

2106
01:29:42.065 --> 01:29:43.445
So we often see

2107
01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:46.485
that our clients make great improvements in their weird

2108
01:29:46.505 --> 01:29:49.205
and tricky long lasting chronic physical symptoms.

2109
01:29:49.755 --> 01:29:51.405
I've had clients who didn't even tell me

2110
01:29:51.405 --> 01:29:52.405
that they had chronic pain.

2111
01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:54.845
They came into the program talking about other things they

2112
01:29:54.845 --> 01:29:57.605
wanted to focus on and then several weeks in they just

2113
01:29:57.605 --> 01:29:58.805
casually mentioned, oh yeah,

2114
01:29:59.025 --> 01:30:01.045
and my chronic pain is 60% better just

2115
01:30:01.045 --> 01:30:02.125
from starting to do this work.

2116
01:30:02.545 --> 01:30:04.285
So we often, often,

2117
01:30:04.295 --> 01:30:06.685
often see great improvements in physical symptoms.

2118
01:30:07.505 --> 01:30:10.075
Will this work for emotional eating, weight loss,

2119
01:30:10.595 --> 01:30:12.555
disordered eating, emotional eating weight struggles?

2120
01:30:13.055 --> 01:30:15.835
Now a reminder, this isn't a weight loss program.

2121
01:30:16.095 --> 01:30:18.475
My goal isn't to focus on your gene size

2122
01:30:19.095 --> 01:30:21.875
and subtle body dysfunction is a major part

2123
01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.395
of what's going on underneath weight loss issues.

2124
01:30:24.825 --> 01:30:26.995
This makes sense when you're struggling with weight loss.

2125
01:30:27.425 --> 01:30:28.875
It's not that you don't know

2126
01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:31.315
that things like a customized healthy diet

2127
01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:32.795
and more exercise are important.

2128
01:30:33.225 --> 01:30:35.875
It's that there's inner conflict, self-sabotage

2129
01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:38.075
and often a lot of trapped trauma under the surface

2130
01:30:38.185 --> 01:30:39.395
that are the real problems.

2131
01:30:39.465 --> 01:30:41.955
When we dissolve those, everything else gets easier.

2132
01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:46.595
Will this work for relationship issues? A huge yes.

2133
01:30:46.595 --> 01:30:49.675
Yes, yes. Here listen, we are wounded in relationship

2134
01:30:49.675 --> 01:30:51.675
and we need to heal in relationship.

2135
01:30:51.745 --> 01:30:55.275
This is why we have such a customized high touch

2136
01:30:55.275 --> 01:30:58.995
personalized program and why subtle body work equips you

2137
01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:01.075
with the skills to not just heal yourself,

2138
01:31:01.415 --> 01:31:03.515
but how to heal your relationships as well.

2139
01:31:03.665 --> 01:31:06.795
This includes family dynamics, deepening friendships

2140
01:31:07.055 --> 01:31:08.755
and how to actually attract the romantic

2141
01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:11.155
and intimate relationships that you're looking for in life.

2142
01:31:11.595 --> 01:31:13.435
Breaking away from old dysfunctional patterns

2143
01:31:13.435 --> 01:31:14.995
of attracting the wrong people.

2144
01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:17.555
We've got whole modules on this in the BWA.

2145
01:31:18.055 --> 01:31:20.755
So while we are not a dating program, we get down

2146
01:31:20.755 --> 01:31:23.235
to the source faster than most expensive dating

2147
01:31:23.555 --> 01:31:24.595
coaching programs out there.

2148
01:31:25.135 --> 01:31:28.355
One of our awesome guys who get it clients, Eric,

2149
01:31:28.495 --> 01:31:31.675
he even found that along the way with building more calm

2150
01:31:31.775 --> 01:31:34.195
and inner confidence through learning subtle body work,

2151
01:31:35.175 --> 01:31:36.555
he actually was able

2152
01:31:36.735 --> 01:31:39.755
to not just fix his chronic sleep prog problems

2153
01:31:39.755 --> 01:31:41.195
and become more confident at work.

2154
01:31:41.615 --> 01:31:43.795
He left the program having more success in dating

2155
01:31:43.815 --> 01:31:45.795
and relating with women and feeling confident

2156
01:31:45.795 --> 01:31:47.875
and successful in that realm of his life.

2157
01:31:49.315 --> 01:31:53.045
Will I get personalized attention? Yes, yes, yes. OMG, yes.

2158
01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:56.925
You have weekly healing calls where you know you're going

2159
01:31:56.925 --> 01:31:58.605
to get your time with a coach

2160
01:31:59.125 --> 01:32:00.245
focusing on what's coming up for you.

2161
01:32:00.705 --> 01:32:03.845
You'll get private one-on-one jumpstart call when you start

2162
01:32:03.845 --> 01:32:05.365
the program right off the bat

2163
01:32:05.365 --> 01:32:07.045
to start customizing your experience.

2164
01:32:07.345 --> 01:32:09.005
You'll get a private onboarding call

2165
01:32:09.005 --> 01:32:10.565
to make sure you're orienting to the process

2166
01:32:10.745 --> 01:32:12.085
and getting all your questions answered.

2167
01:32:12.465 --> 01:32:14.845
You get personalized check-ins at program milestones

2168
01:32:14.865 --> 01:32:17.725
and you get in back inbox support anytime you need it.

2169
01:32:18.025 --> 01:32:19.685
And you also get to ask me any questions

2170
01:32:19.685 --> 01:32:21.325
and challenges you're having directly on

2171
01:32:21.325 --> 01:32:22.365
my Leslie teaching calls.

2172
01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:26.445
So those are also recorded so you can always go back

2173
01:32:26.465 --> 01:32:27.965
and watch the replay in the course.

2174
01:32:28.385 --> 01:32:30.965
You will even have the option to add in additional coaching

2175
01:32:30.965 --> 01:32:34.645
with me personally as a supplement option if you want to add

2176
01:32:34.645 --> 01:32:35.885
that onto your tuition.

2177
01:32:35.885 --> 01:32:37.285
We call that the Leslie track.

2178
01:32:37.665 --> 01:32:39.405
So that's extra but it's available to you.

2179
01:32:41.035 --> 01:32:42.285
I've already done a lot of work.

2180
01:32:42.465 --> 01:32:45.085
Is this really going to be different? Good question.

2181
01:32:45.425 --> 01:32:48.605
Listen, this program is not for complete newbies

2182
01:32:49.065 --> 01:32:51.685
or people who haven't even recognized that their mind

2183
01:32:51.685 --> 01:32:53.445
and body are deeply interconnected.

2184
01:32:53.505 --> 01:32:56.365
If you're here, you've done all the things,

2185
01:32:56.545 --> 01:32:57.685
you get it already,

2186
01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.125
but there is a difference between getting it

2187
01:33:00.235 --> 01:33:02.325
between having gone through trainings like yoga,

2188
01:33:02.325 --> 01:33:03.845
teacher training, health coach training.

2189
01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.885
There's a difference between knowing it

2190
01:33:06.265 --> 01:33:08.925
and even between being able to advise and help other people

2191
01:33:09.465 --> 01:33:10.565
and being able to truly

2192
01:33:10.745 --> 01:33:14.245
and holistically embody the healing in yourself.

2193
01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:17.005
That level of healing is what we do here.

2194
01:33:17.265 --> 01:33:19.365
It takes direct personal mentorship

2195
01:33:19.745 --> 01:33:21.525
and it takes truly comprehensive

2196
01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.965
and integrated knowledge of the subtle body

2197
01:33:24.425 --> 01:33:26.085
and how the reality of healing

2198
01:33:26.145 --> 01:33:27.405
and the technical side of trauma

2199
01:33:27.505 --> 01:33:30.365
and even spirituality actually work in the mind body system.

2200
01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:33.245
And that's something that you won't find anywhere else.

2201
01:33:33.905 --> 01:33:37.365
If you are a serious seeker, empath, workshop junkie,

2202
01:33:37.365 --> 01:33:38.725
trained therapist or coach

2203
01:33:38.825 --> 01:33:41.765
and you have arrived, this is for you.

2204
01:33:42.385 --> 01:33:44.805
One of my dear friends who is a trained somatic therapist

2205
01:33:45.465 --> 01:33:48.645
and went to one of the top interpersonal psychology schools

2206
01:33:48.645 --> 01:33:51.845
in the country, she went through the BWA training

2207
01:33:51.905 --> 01:33:54.685
and she said, Leslie, this is like a little bit like

2208
01:33:54.685 --> 01:33:57.685
what I learned in school with somatic therapy but way faster

2209
01:33:57.785 --> 01:33:59.165
and way deeper and you don't have

2210
01:33:59.165 --> 01:34:01.485
to talk about all the stuff endlessly with your clients.

2211
01:34:01.585 --> 01:34:03.805
So she still uses this work with her clients.

2212
01:34:03.945 --> 01:34:08.525
Now what if I tend to start strong with new programs

2213
01:34:08.525 --> 01:34:10.645
and then I fall off the wagon or procrastinate?

2214
01:34:11.075 --> 01:34:13.245
Good news, we have a name for that.

2215
01:34:13.435 --> 01:34:14.565
It's called resistance

2216
01:34:14.665 --> 01:34:15.805
and we understand

2217
01:34:15.985 --> 01:34:19.005
how it works on a subtle body technical level.

2218
01:34:19.985 --> 01:34:22.525
We work directly with resistance in this program

2219
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:24.405
and it's one of the things that makes this program

2220
01:34:24.505 --> 01:34:28.685
so unique dealing with an unwinding the source of resistance

2221
01:34:28.745 --> 01:34:32.325
and reprogramming your protector system are two of the keys

2222
01:34:32.325 --> 01:34:34.645
that almost every other modality misses.

2223
01:34:35.145 --> 01:34:36.965
So if you felt like you do great

2224
01:34:36.985 --> 01:34:38.285
and new things for a hot minute,

2225
01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.125
but then you either sort of like forget about them

2226
01:34:40.145 --> 01:34:42.725
or seem to go back to old patterns, we've got you covered.

2227
01:34:42.945 --> 01:34:45.045
So you will be able to actually walk up

2228
01:34:45.045 --> 01:34:47.085
and over that mountain to the other side

2229
01:34:47.105 --> 01:34:48.805
and we'll be right there with you along the way.

2230
01:34:48.835 --> 01:34:51.165
That is inherent in part of this training.

2231
01:34:52.475 --> 01:34:54.575
Is everything included? Are there additional charges?

2232
01:34:54.685 --> 01:34:57.525
Once I'm in the program, everything we provide you

2233
01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.125
with is covered in the program, in the curriculum

2234
01:35:00.265 --> 01:35:02.685
and your year of access, all the live support,

2235
01:35:02.785 --> 01:35:04.525
all the calls, all of the curriculum.

2236
01:35:05.145 --> 01:35:07.965
As a bonus, when you start your BWA experience,

2237
01:35:07.965 --> 01:35:09.565
you'll have the future option

2238
01:35:09.985 --> 01:35:12.245
to potentially attend an in-person workshop

2239
01:35:12.245 --> 01:35:14.925
and event that is different from the training,

2240
01:35:14.945 --> 01:35:18.285
the core training itself, it's a um, separate sort of thing

2241
01:35:18.305 --> 01:35:19.925
and you'll have the option to come of one

2242
01:35:19.925 --> 01:35:22.405
of those in the future, but that is uh, separate.

2243
01:35:22.515 --> 01:35:24.885
Some people come, some people don't. So that's not included.

2244
01:35:24.945 --> 01:35:27.245
And if you did choose to come to that in the future,

2245
01:35:27.395 --> 01:35:29.405
that would be extra in terms of going to that,

2246
01:35:29.405 --> 01:35:31.285
everything else is included for the 12 weeks.

2247
01:35:32.475 --> 01:35:36.525
What if I'm not good at technology? We have got you covered.

2248
01:35:36.705 --> 01:35:39.005
We use very simple technology.

2249
01:35:39.065 --> 01:35:41.205
We zoom and one community platform,

2250
01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:44.365
we get great feedback from our clients about we do not use

2251
01:35:44.685 --> 01:35:46.925
Facebook or Facebook groups for this program fulfillment.

2252
01:35:47.305 --> 01:35:49.325
And we walk you through it Each step of the way.

2253
01:35:49.335 --> 01:35:51.245
There is a one-on-one onboarding call

2254
01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.605
to make sure everything is clear

2255
01:35:52.825 --> 01:35:54.845
and you can always reach out for help along the way.

2256
01:35:55.105 --> 01:35:57.765
We have had clients in their seventies use this technology.

2257
01:35:58.825 --> 01:36:01.075
Another question I sometimes get, I'm a Christian,

2258
01:36:01.075 --> 01:36:02.795
will this work for my religious beliefs?

2259
01:36:03.255 --> 01:36:05.915
Yes, whatever spirituality you are,

2260
01:36:06.065 --> 01:36:08.275
whichever religious tradition you're coming from,

2261
01:36:08.385 --> 01:36:11.235
your spirituality is an important part of your healing.

2262
01:36:11.415 --> 01:36:12.795
And this program is compatible

2263
01:36:12.865 --> 01:36:14.755
with whatever religious tradition you follow.

2264
01:36:15.135 --> 01:36:18.035
We do not promote any particular religious belief

2265
01:36:18.095 --> 01:36:20.195
and respect and encourage you to deepen

2266
01:36:20.495 --> 01:36:22.675
and integrate your personal spirituality

2267
01:36:22.905 --> 01:36:23.995
into your healing process.

2268
01:36:25.415 --> 01:36:27.315
How long will it take to start feeling better?

2269
01:36:27.895 --> 01:36:29.995
You'll start noticing the difference of

2270
01:36:30.055 --> 01:36:32.755
how your body is responding right away

2271
01:36:33.015 --> 01:36:35.555
and starting to dissolve these old patterns.

2272
01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:37.995
You'll be able to feel things happening within your mind

2273
01:36:37.995 --> 01:36:41.075
body system and this is a 12 week program.

2274
01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.995
So there's going to be phases of healing

2275
01:36:42.995 --> 01:36:44.475
that do not happen all at once.

2276
01:36:44.945 --> 01:36:46.315
It's a step-by-step process

2277
01:36:46.495 --> 01:36:48.795
and I'm going to show you along the way how

2278
01:36:48.795 --> 01:36:51.995
to notice the healing signs of your system, how to know

2279
01:36:52.055 --> 01:36:54.315
and sort of decode how things are progressing

2280
01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:57.235
and you will start to see the results showing up in your

2281
01:36:57.245 --> 01:36:58.275
outer world as well.

2282
01:36:59.155 --> 01:37:01.515
I had one client who had been doing a lot of inner work

2283
01:37:01.535 --> 01:37:04.595
for a while and she said on a healing call once she was

2284
01:37:04.595 --> 01:37:07.195
like, Leslie, you told me that.

2285
01:37:07.235 --> 01:37:10.395
I like you said, I wasn't really gonna notice it all at once

2286
01:37:10.495 --> 01:37:12.155
and I wasn't really paying attention to that,

2287
01:37:12.295 --> 01:37:16.395
but I, for as long as I can remember, have had this sort

2288
01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:18.395
of really negative voice in my head.

2289
01:37:18.665 --> 01:37:21.795
Therapy's called it the inner critic, just like really mean

2290
01:37:21.815 --> 01:37:24.835
and nasty and sometimes I even have to just would have

2291
01:37:24.835 --> 01:37:26.555
to get up and walk around just

2292
01:37:26.555 --> 01:37:28.995
because it was just so intense that I had to try

2293
01:37:28.995 --> 01:37:30.115
to shake it out of my mind.

2294
01:37:30.455 --> 01:37:31.835
And she said, I just noticed.

2295
01:37:32.615 --> 01:37:34.075
But I realized the other day

2296
01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:38.235
that I don't remember the last time I heard that voice.

2297
01:37:38.665 --> 01:37:40.875
It's actually gone and I hadn't even noticed.

2298
01:37:40.995 --> 01:37:43.715
I just noticed now that it hasn't been there anymore.

2299
01:37:44.495 --> 01:37:46.755
So things will happen along the way

2300
01:37:47.225 --> 01:37:48.995
that you're not even tracking with

2301
01:37:48.995 --> 01:37:51.275
and then you'll realize, oh s**t, that's not there anymore.

2302
01:37:51.495 --> 01:37:54.475
So that's a little bit of how the results tend to unfold.

2303
01:37:55.775 --> 01:37:58.115
Is this process going to cause me to get overwhelmed

2304
01:37:58.375 --> 01:38:00.515
or cause me to spin out or have a healing crisis?

2305
01:38:01.335 --> 01:38:06.155
Now a lot of people have done strong one-time type

2306
01:38:06.155 --> 01:38:08.395
of healing interventions that blew the doors open,

2307
01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:11.595
some intensive breath work, medicine journeys, workshops.

2308
01:38:11.905 --> 01:38:15.995
They have felt, um, sort of destabilized in their life

2309
01:38:16.145 --> 01:38:19.515
because they had this big sort of forceful healing opening,

2310
01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:22.435
but there was no support to integrate afterwards

2311
01:38:22.435 --> 01:38:23.755
and that can feel destabilizing.

2312
01:38:23.755 --> 01:38:25.435
So if that's you, I understand why you

2313
01:38:25.435 --> 01:38:26.595
might feel worried about that.

2314
01:38:27.295 --> 01:38:30.115
But the way that subtle body works is different

2315
01:38:30.385 --> 01:38:33.155
because one, we don't use dynamite.

2316
01:38:33.475 --> 01:38:34.915
Amateurs use dynamite.

2317
01:38:35.535 --> 01:38:40.035
We use a customized process to work with your subtle body

2318
01:38:40.055 --> 01:38:42.995
and your protector system so that you can tolerate

2319
01:38:43.255 --> 01:38:45.435
and integrate this each step along the way

2320
01:38:45.585 --> 01:38:46.755
that is lasting healing.

2321
01:38:47.055 --> 01:38:49.195
And we're here with you. That's why this is a 12 week

2322
01:38:49.195 --> 01:38:51.075
program with tons of personalized support.

2323
01:38:51.535 --> 01:38:53.435
So generally our clients don't need to go

2324
01:38:53.435 --> 01:38:55.155
through some huge healing crisis

2325
01:38:55.155 --> 01:38:58.635
because this modality is very precise and specific

2326
01:38:59.095 --> 01:39:01.595
and follows your innate healing in

2327
01:39:01.655 --> 01:39:03.155
and helping you move into new ways.

2328
01:39:03.655 --> 01:39:06.115
So sometimes people's specific systems need

2329
01:39:06.115 --> 01:39:07.475
to customize our longer support

2330
01:39:07.495 --> 01:39:10.275
and we adjust based on your subtle body assessment

2331
01:39:10.335 --> 01:39:11.435
of how you're progressing.

2332
01:39:12.915 --> 01:39:15.655
Is this really the only time I'll see this?

2333
01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:17.615
Trust your gut fast action price.

2334
01:39:18.195 --> 01:39:20.735
Yes, and it's the lowest price you'll

2335
01:39:20.735 --> 01:39:21.775
ever see for our program.

2336
01:39:22.075 --> 01:39:24.415
It means that it's not some

2337
01:39:24.415 --> 01:39:25.695
gimmick that we play around with.

2338
01:39:25.725 --> 01:39:29.295
It's a serious offering to honor your soul alignment

2339
01:39:29.435 --> 01:39:30.575
to do this work together.

2340
01:39:30.875 --> 01:39:32.135
So we don't mess around with that.

2341
01:39:32.605 --> 01:39:36.215
Even after this opportunity is gone, you won't see a sale

2342
01:39:36.315 --> 01:39:38.055
or a discount, which we don't do.

2343
01:39:38.115 --> 01:39:40.015
On principle. This is therapeutic work.

2344
01:39:40.575 --> 01:39:42.895
I never want people to regret purchasing

2345
01:39:42.895 --> 01:39:44.975
because they saw a lower tuition later on.

2346
01:39:45.075 --> 01:39:46.895
And I don't want people to sort

2347
01:39:46.895 --> 01:39:49.055
of postpone their healing just in case they think there's a

2348
01:39:49.055 --> 01:39:50.655
coupon code that's coming down the line.

2349
01:39:50.955 --> 01:39:52.775
So of course you will be able

2350
01:39:52.775 --> 01:39:56.135
to enroll in the future if you miss this opportunity at the

2351
01:39:56.135 --> 01:39:57.375
normal enrollment rate.

2352
01:39:57.755 --> 01:40:00.615
But why pay a thousand dollars more just for a few more days

2353
01:40:00.635 --> 01:40:04.865
to decide what makes this program

2354
01:40:05.015 --> 01:40:06.585
different from other programs?

2355
01:40:07.135 --> 01:40:10.385
Good question. The first thing I want you to know here is

2356
01:40:10.385 --> 01:40:13.905
that none of this is hypothetical theory or guesswork.

2357
01:40:14.255 --> 01:40:17.465
This is literally the system that I personally developed

2358
01:40:17.645 --> 01:40:18.905
to transform my own life

2359
01:40:18.905 --> 01:40:20.945
and help my clients get breakthrough results in their

2360
01:40:20.945 --> 01:40:24.465
healing and lives even when everything else had failed.

2361
01:40:25.245 --> 01:40:27.465
And because I personally developed it,

2362
01:40:27.525 --> 01:40:29.025
you will not find it anywhere else.

2363
01:40:29.215 --> 01:40:30.985
This isn't one of those situations

2364
01:40:30.985 --> 01:40:33.825
where someone learning something from someone else

2365
01:40:33.885 --> 01:40:35.625
or taking a training and then deciding

2366
01:40:35.685 --> 01:40:37.185
to create a course to teach it.

2367
01:40:37.465 --> 01:40:39.505
Although you know, no offense to people who teach modalities

2368
01:40:39.505 --> 01:40:40.585
that they've learned from others.

2369
01:40:41.585 --> 01:40:43.305
I have been developing

2370
01:40:43.325 --> 01:40:45.985
and using this system with my own clinical patients

2371
01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:48.025
before ever even training others.

2372
01:40:48.085 --> 01:40:50.105
So I took a lot of time in perfecting it.

2373
01:40:50.205 --> 01:40:52.985
It is a time-tested, proven system that gets results.

2374
01:40:53.705 --> 01:40:56.805
And I can't separate my background from

2375
01:40:56.805 --> 01:40:57.925
what I teach and live.

2376
01:40:57.995 --> 01:41:01.125
This is my life's work and part of my purpose in this life.

2377
01:41:01.605 --> 01:41:04.285
I have been meditating, doing yoga since I was a teenager.

2378
01:41:04.605 --> 01:41:06.885
I graduated from the top acupuncture school in the us.

2379
01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:10.605
I have over a decade of full-time, clinical level experience

2380
01:41:10.825 --> 01:41:12.125
of working with clients.

2381
01:41:12.795 --> 01:41:14.885
This is what I have been doing my whole life.

2382
01:41:15.505 --> 01:41:18.685
And this is not to throw shade on anyone else.

2383
01:41:18.735 --> 01:41:22.445
There are a lot of people who are called to do healing work

2384
01:41:22.445 --> 01:41:24.845
with people in different forms and that is wonderful.

2385
01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:28.605
It's a blessing. And when it comes to the healing arts,

2386
01:41:28.925 --> 01:41:32.085
I can tell you that there is a categorical difference

2387
01:41:32.355 --> 01:41:34.245
between being guided by someone

2388
01:41:34.585 --> 01:41:36.245
who has taken a few workshops

2389
01:41:36.245 --> 01:41:38.565
and certifications to someone hold,

2390
01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.605
who holds a medical license level.

2391
01:41:41.045 --> 01:41:42.885
Clinical degree, has gone through comprehensive,

2392
01:41:42.885 --> 01:41:45.885
traditional medical training, has actual experience.

2393
01:41:46.805 --> 01:41:48.925
I love cool crystals as much as the next person.

2394
01:41:49.305 --> 01:41:50.725
But when you get in a car accident,

2395
01:41:50.745 --> 01:41:52.325
you don't whip out your singing bowls.

2396
01:41:52.745 --> 01:41:55.685
So when you have longtime held trauma in your body,

2397
01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:58.645
when you need a comprehensive approach, you go

2398
01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:01.085
to longtime experts with the qualification

2399
01:42:01.105 --> 01:42:03.965
and proven track record if you want results, not someone

2400
01:42:03.965 --> 01:42:05.205
who just sort of got into something

2401
01:42:05.205 --> 01:42:06.245
and took a weekend workshop.

2402
01:42:07.275 --> 01:42:09.205
When it comes down to is this, my team

2403
01:42:09.305 --> 01:42:11.365
and I are deeply, deeply

2404
01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.525
invested in you living the life you are meant to live.

2405
01:42:14.955 --> 01:42:18.925
This is a soul aligned dharmic healing process that we offer

2406
01:42:19.185 --> 01:42:21.405
and we're here to walk with you each step of the way.

2407
01:42:21.725 --> 01:42:24.285
I want you to experience the freedom and joy

2408
01:42:24.385 --> 01:42:25.925
and yes, the relief

2409
01:42:26.425 --> 01:42:29.085
of actually being your true authentic self without the

2410
01:42:29.085 --> 01:42:31.485
burdens of the past, without the self-sabotage

2411
01:42:31.505 --> 01:42:33.845
and inner critic, without the generational

2412
01:42:33.845 --> 01:42:35.005
baggage you've been carrying.

2413
01:42:35.605 --> 01:42:36.725
I want you to realize

2414
01:42:36.945 --> 01:42:38.165
and actually manifest

2415
01:42:38.165 --> 01:42:39.725
what you know is there under the surface,

2416
01:42:40.225 --> 01:42:43.085
but haven't been able to bring out into your life

2417
01:42:43.085 --> 01:42:45.365
because of the subtle body blocks that were in the way.

2418
01:42:45.715 --> 01:42:48.805
This is true success and that's what I want for you.

2419
01:42:50.365 --> 01:42:53.265
So lemme just cover a couple other of those, okay?

2420
01:42:53.485 --> 01:42:56.185
But because I can tell you're thinking them, okay,

2421
01:42:56.325 --> 01:42:58.665
but it feels scary to invest in myself.

2422
01:42:58.665 --> 01:43:00.785
Isn't that being selfish? Whew girl.

2423
01:43:01.485 --> 01:43:03.265
One of the things that sensitive folks,

2424
01:43:03.445 --> 01:43:06.625
and this is particularly true for women, is

2425
01:43:06.625 --> 01:43:08.065
that we have been conditioned

2426
01:43:08.065 --> 01:43:10.385
to put everyone else first, but ourselves.

2427
01:43:10.735 --> 01:43:13.465
This is a lack of wisdom understanding about

2428
01:43:13.485 --> 01:43:16.945
how things actually work and often part of our cultural

2429
01:43:16.945 --> 01:43:18.865
and religious or patriarchal upbringings.

2430
01:43:18.965 --> 01:43:20.825
So if you're feeling this, you're not alone.

2431
01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:24.905
What we know even from western social science perspective,

2432
01:43:24.905 --> 01:43:27.665
from studies done by organizations like UNESCO

2433
01:43:27.665 --> 01:43:30.025
and the Brookings Institute is that when women

2434
01:43:30.085 --> 01:43:31.265
and girls are healthier

2435
01:43:31.325 --> 01:43:34.545
and have access to the resources, the education

2436
01:43:34.545 --> 01:43:37.585
that they need, their families and communities do better.

2437
01:43:38.325 --> 01:43:40.705
You know this, in your own experience in yourself,

2438
01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:43.345
if you had a mother or even a grandmother, an aunt

2439
01:43:43.725 --> 01:43:45.065
who was emotionally unhealthy,

2440
01:43:45.725 --> 01:43:48.825
if they were operating from their trauma, you can see

2441
01:43:49.015 --> 01:43:52.245
what a negative impact that had on your family in

2442
01:43:52.345 --> 01:43:53.605
so many areas of life.

2443
01:43:54.475 --> 01:43:55.965
They were doing the best that they can,

2444
01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:58.005
but if they were acting from trauma,

2445
01:43:58.585 --> 01:44:00.325
it did harm in the family system.

2446
01:44:01.265 --> 01:44:04.005
If you were lucky enough to have an emotionally healthy mom

2447
01:44:04.065 --> 01:44:07.285
or a grandmother, a woman close to you, you can also feel

2448
01:44:07.395 --> 01:44:10.325
what an immense source of support that

2449
01:44:10.325 --> 01:44:11.565
that was in your own life.

2450
01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:15.845
You investing in your own healing is the thing

2451
01:44:15.845 --> 01:44:17.765
that allows you to show up for others.

2452
01:44:18.355 --> 01:44:20.045
This isn't just about you personally.

2453
01:44:20.045 --> 01:44:22.845
This is about you being able to show up not just

2454
01:44:22.845 --> 01:44:24.325
for your spouse, but for your children,

2455
01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:27.805
but also the impact that you can have in the outer world.

2456
01:44:28.475 --> 01:44:31.365
True leaders put their oxygen masks on first.

2457
01:44:31.825 --> 01:44:32.965
That's what allows them

2458
01:44:32.985 --> 01:44:35.725
to keep serving others in such an impactful way.

2459
01:44:36.545 --> 01:44:38.165
So if it seems scary

2460
01:44:38.165 --> 01:44:39.965
because you've never invested in yourself,

2461
01:44:40.125 --> 01:44:42.525
I totally understand I was there once too and myself,

2462
01:44:43.185 --> 01:44:46.125
but this is an invitation to uplevel your life

2463
01:44:46.345 --> 01:44:47.645
and to support yourself

2464
01:44:48.105 --> 01:44:50.485
and those around you in a way that's beyond

2465
01:44:50.755 --> 01:44:52.285
what you've been able to do before.

2466
01:44:53.105 --> 01:44:55.045
It always is gonna feel like a little bit

2467
01:44:55.045 --> 01:44:56.205
of a leap the first time.

2468
01:44:56.425 --> 01:45:00.435
So that's normal if that's what you're feeling, okay,

2469
01:45:00.495 --> 01:45:02.795
but I've invested in programs before

2470
01:45:02.815 --> 01:45:03.835
and I didn't get results.

2471
01:45:03.865 --> 01:45:05.275
What if it doesn't work for me?

2472
01:45:05.625 --> 01:45:09.115
Because most of our clients have been working on themselves

2473
01:45:09.215 --> 01:45:11.075
for years and still feeling stuck.

2474
01:45:11.265 --> 01:45:14.115
It's natural that you may have had experiences in the past

2475
01:45:14.115 --> 01:45:15.875
where you felt like something didn't work for you.

2476
01:45:16.165 --> 01:45:19.355
Often, other methods just aren't comprehensive enough

2477
01:45:19.415 --> 01:45:21.195
to work for a wide range of people.

2478
01:45:21.375 --> 01:45:23.595
So they're hitting it for some and missing it for others.

2479
01:45:24.265 --> 01:45:28.075
This is why I actually offer people a money back guarantee

2480
01:45:28.145 --> 01:45:31.595
with our program, which is unheard of in the healing world,

2481
01:45:31.775 --> 01:45:34.235
mostly because people can't guarantee results.

2482
01:45:34.735 --> 01:45:37.275
So this is part of what we do different.

2483
01:45:37.275 --> 01:45:38.835
There's actually no risk to you.

2484
01:45:39.115 --> 01:45:41.395
I am so freaking confident in our methods

2485
01:45:41.695 --> 01:45:43.635
and we've tested them over and over

2486
01:45:43.655 --> 01:45:45.995
and over again with people from all walks of life

2487
01:45:46.265 --> 01:45:48.395
that I'm actually able to make you this guarantee.

2488
01:45:48.655 --> 01:45:50.755
We track over 35 data points

2489
01:45:50.855 --> 01:45:52.875
for every single person who comes in the door.

2490
01:45:53.175 --> 01:45:55.675
So we know this works. We're not guessing. We have data.

2491
01:45:56.295 --> 01:45:59.235
So if you enroll in the Body Wisdom Academy, if you show up

2492
01:45:59.235 --> 01:46:02.035
and you go through the process and follow the coaching,

2493
01:46:02.415 --> 01:46:03.715
and you follow the system

2494
01:46:04.335 --> 01:46:06.795
and for some reason you don't get actual results

2495
01:46:06.815 --> 01:46:08.835
and changes in your markers that we're tracking,

2496
01:46:09.105 --> 01:46:10.595
I'll actually refund your tuition.

2497
01:46:10.695 --> 01:46:12.955
So you literally have nothing to lose.

2498
01:46:13.755 --> 01:46:16.315
I know that this is helpful when you've been through

2499
01:46:16.315 --> 01:46:18.235
so much in the past, so that's part of why we offer it.

2500
01:46:19.305 --> 01:46:23.795
Okay, but can I just do a single session and try it out?

2501
01:46:24.315 --> 01:46:27.475
I know your protector system tells you that you just need

2502
01:46:27.475 --> 01:46:29.035
to quote unquote try it out.

2503
01:46:29.575 --> 01:46:31.475
You don't need to try an ice cream sundae

2504
01:46:31.475 --> 01:46:32.475
to know it's gonna be sweet

2505
01:46:32.615 --> 01:46:34.235
and you don't go to your doctor asking

2506
01:46:34.235 --> 01:46:36.915
to try a little surgery to see how you like it.

2507
01:46:37.575 --> 01:46:39.915
Here's the questions that you should ask instead,

2508
01:46:40.545 --> 01:46:42.435
does this person know what they're talking about?

2509
01:46:43.015 --> 01:46:45.395
Has this produced the results that I want

2510
01:46:45.815 --> 01:46:47.315
or similar for other people?

2511
01:46:48.415 --> 01:46:50.705
What's really needed is to

2512
01:46:51.265 --> 01:46:54.305
identify your real underlying issue in your subtle body

2513
01:46:54.405 --> 01:46:55.665
and consult the expert

2514
01:46:55.665 --> 01:46:57.585
and system to address that very issue

2515
01:46:57.895 --> 01:47:00.945
that will get you the results and benefit if your mind

2516
01:47:01.045 --> 01:47:02.785
and trying it could've gotten you out

2517
01:47:02.785 --> 01:47:03.825
of this, it would've already.

2518
01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:06.025
So the mind story that you'll somehow know

2519
01:47:06.085 --> 01:47:08.265
by trying a little is just mind fear

2520
01:47:08.415 --> 01:47:10.105
that isn't going to get you where you wanna go.

2521
01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:14.835
Okay, but it's just not the right

2522
01:47:14.835 --> 01:47:15.955
time for me to get started.

2523
01:47:16.835 --> 01:47:18.835
I get it. I get that we are busy people,

2524
01:47:19.335 --> 01:47:21.275
but let's take a look at that life

2525
01:47:21.295 --> 01:47:22.795
and healing kind of facts here.

2526
01:47:23.495 --> 01:47:25.675
If you're not in your body,

2527
01:47:26.015 --> 01:47:28.075
if your trauma is running the show,

2528
01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:30.355
if you have unhealed subtle body blocks,

2529
01:47:30.935 --> 01:47:33.035
you are not really helping anyone.

2530
01:47:33.055 --> 01:47:34.755
You're not really actually even living

2531
01:47:34.755 --> 01:47:35.955
your true, authentic self.

2532
01:47:36.015 --> 01:47:37.795
You are perpetuating trauma.

2533
01:47:38.295 --> 01:47:41.315
You are living a surface life going through the motions.

2534
01:47:41.935 --> 01:47:45.675
So if you are waiting for some calm, serene time

2535
01:47:45.935 --> 01:47:48.275
to engage in this work, it will never come

2536
01:47:48.665 --> 01:47:49.995
because the trauma

2537
01:47:50.135 --> 01:47:53.035
and your protector system itself is part of the thing

2538
01:47:53.035 --> 01:47:56.035
that makes it feel like it's never the right time.

2539
01:47:56.265 --> 01:47:57.995
It's not just always that life is busy.

2540
01:47:58.025 --> 01:48:00.035
It's also that trauma is keeping us running

2541
01:48:00.135 --> 01:48:01.315
in fight or flight mode.

2542
01:48:02.135 --> 01:48:04.835
And if the issue is just actually

2543
01:48:04.835 --> 01:48:06.275
that you've stumbled on this training

2544
01:48:06.655 --> 01:48:09.315
or this healing opportunity at a moment when your schedule

2545
01:48:09.615 --> 01:48:12.995
is a little bit full, remember you can still enroll

2546
01:48:13.015 --> 01:48:16.195
and then reach out and the team will help you right away

2547
01:48:16.295 --> 01:48:18.115
to let us know that you need a delayed start.

2548
01:48:18.385 --> 01:48:20.035
That way, you still get the benefit

2549
01:48:20.415 --> 01:48:23.395
of this super special trust your gut action taker

2550
01:48:23.815 --> 01:48:25.435
and you get the time that you need.

2551
01:48:27.275 --> 01:48:28.575
Now, before we end,

2552
01:48:29.205 --> 01:48:30.735
I've got one more parting thought for you.

2553
01:48:30.795 --> 01:48:32.855
Really comes down to two choices.

2554
01:48:33.115 --> 01:48:36.575
Choice one is keep doing what you're doing and feeling stuck

2555
01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:37.895
and just somehow cross your fingers

2556
01:48:37.895 --> 01:48:40.575
that is gonna get better, which we all know generally things

2557
01:48:40.645 --> 01:48:42.935
left to their own devices tend to get worse.

2558
01:48:43.835 --> 01:48:46.495
Now, I know I don't know you very well yet,

2559
01:48:46.635 --> 01:48:49.335
but if you are like the majority of people who are ready

2560
01:48:49.395 --> 01:48:51.895
for these deeper methods and healing, you're feeling stuck

2561
01:48:51.955 --> 01:48:54.215
and struggling, you know you need healing,

2562
01:48:54.395 --> 01:48:56.815
but you've been doing all the right things that they say,

2563
01:48:56.815 --> 01:48:58.535
working on yourself, going to therapy,

2564
01:48:58.755 --> 01:48:59.975
trying all the things,

2565
01:49:00.555 --> 01:49:01.975
and while they've helped a little bit here

2566
01:49:01.975 --> 01:49:04.375
and there, you still feel blocked in some fundamental ways.

2567
01:49:04.485 --> 01:49:06.095
Instead of living your sole purpose,

2568
01:49:06.495 --> 01:49:07.775
enjoying fulfilling relationships

2569
01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:10.095
and really showing up as your authentic self,

2570
01:49:10.155 --> 01:49:12.655
you still feel like an imposter kind of scrambling

2571
01:49:12.655 --> 01:49:14.215
for the next healing trick

2572
01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:16.015
that doesn't really pay off or worse.

2573
01:49:16.235 --> 01:49:18.415
You're getting to the place where you're starting

2574
01:49:18.635 --> 01:49:20.015
to believe the mind lie,

2575
01:49:20.015 --> 01:49:21.855
that there's inherently something wrong with you

2576
01:49:22.315 --> 01:49:24.535
and that healing can work for everyone else but you.

2577
01:49:24.935 --> 01:49:27.695
I don't want you to be there. And then there's choice number

2578
01:49:27.755 --> 01:49:30.415
two, which is to commit to your integrated healing

2579
01:49:31.075 --> 01:49:33.055
as your guiding light priority.

2580
01:49:33.235 --> 01:49:34.935
To decide to make that change

2581
01:49:35.475 --> 01:49:38.775
and to try a new approach of subtle body work

2582
01:49:38.795 --> 01:49:41.295
to healing all the levels of your subtle body

2583
01:49:41.845 --> 01:49:44.415
that puts you back in the driver's seat of your life,

2584
01:49:45.005 --> 01:49:47.445
your sense of true confidence that aligns you

2585
01:49:47.445 --> 01:49:49.405
with your authentic self and your life purpose.

2586
01:49:50.185 --> 01:49:51.645
The second choice is the one

2587
01:49:51.645 --> 01:49:55.405
that gives you the truly integrated understanding so

2588
01:49:55.405 --> 01:49:57.565
that you always know how to actually shift

2589
01:49:57.705 --> 01:49:58.885
how you're feeling in the moment,

2590
01:49:59.065 --> 01:50:00.805
so you never get separated from the

2591
01:50:01.005 --> 01:50:02.165
grounded truth of who you are.

2592
01:50:02.825 --> 01:50:04.805
The choice is between continuing to struggle

2593
01:50:05.145 --> 01:50:07.605
or choosing to take control of your healing

2594
01:50:07.705 --> 01:50:09.405
and success with soul aligned support.

2595
01:50:10.025 --> 01:50:13.565
If now is your time, I welcome you to take the next step

2596
01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:15.925
and enroll, and I look forward to walking

2597
01:50:15.925 --> 01:50:17.845
with you on this sacred path together.

2598
01:50:18.295 --> 01:50:20.125
Super blessings on your health,

2599
01:50:20.435 --> 01:50:22.285
your healing, your inner world.

2600
01:50:22.615 --> 01:50:23.885
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
